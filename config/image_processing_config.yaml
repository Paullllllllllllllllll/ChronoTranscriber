# Image processing configuration
image_processing:
  target_dpi: 300  # The resolution (in dots per inch) at which images will be extracted and processed. A higher DPI can improve clarity for OCR but may increase processing time.
  grayscale_conversion: true  # When enabled, converts colored images to grayscale. This reduction of color noise can improve OCR accuracy.
  handle_transparency: true  # When enabled, processes images with transparent backgrounds by placing them on a white background for consistent OCR input.
  # Controls the fidelity of images sent to the LLM via the Responses API.
  # - high: better fidelity OCR, potentially higher token usage
  # - low: faster/cheaper, lower fidelity
  # - auto: omit the parameter and let the model decide
  llm_detail: high

  # JPEG compression quality (1-100) used when saving processed images.
  jpeg_quality: 100

  # Resizing behavior prior to sending to the LLM
  # - auto: choose a resizing strategy based on llm_detail
  # - none: do not resize (only transparency/grayscale steps applied)
  resize_profile: high

  # Parameters for resizing profiles
  # For low detail, cap the longest side to this many pixels (preserve aspect ratio)
  low_max_side_px: 512
  # For high detail, fit into this box (width, height) with padding as needed
  high_target_box: [768, 1536]

ocr:
  tesseract_config: "--oem 3 --psm 6"  # Tesseract OCR configuration options: '--oem 3' selects the default OCR engine mode, and '--psm 6' assumes a single uniform block of text.
