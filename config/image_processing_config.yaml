# Image processing configuration
image_processing:
  target_dpi: 300  # The resolution (in dots per inch) at which images will be extracted and processed. A higher DPI can improve clarity for OCR but may increase processing time.
  grayscale_conversion: true  # When enabled, converts colored images to grayscale. This reduction of color noise can improve OCR accuracy.
  border_removal:
    enabled: true  # Enables a pre-processing step that automatically removes borders or margins from images to eliminate unwanted background elements.
    border_color: 255  # The pixel intensity value (typically white) that is considered as the border color for detection.
    tolerance: 7  # Specifies the acceptable deviation from the defined border color during border detection, accommodating slight brightness variations.
  adjust_dpi:
    min_pixels: 1500  # The minimum number of pixels for image dimensions during DPI adjustment. Images below this threshold will be upscaled to ensure sufficient resolution.
    max_pixels: 3000  # The maximum number of pixels allowed after DPI adjustment, preventing images from becoming excessively large and slowing down processing.
  handle_transparency: true  # When enabled, processes images with transparent backgrounds by placing them on a white background for consistent OCR input.

ocr:
  tesseract_config: "--oem 3 --psm 6"  # Tesseract OCR configuration options: '--oem 3' selects the default OCR engine mode, and '--psm 6' assumes a single uniform block of text.
