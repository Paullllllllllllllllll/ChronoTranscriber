# Post-processing settings for transcription output cleanup
# These settings apply to the final transcription text before writing to file.
# Post-processing cleans up OCR artifacts, normalizes whitespace, and optionally
# wraps long lines while preserving Markdown formatting and semantic content.
postprocessing:
  # Master toggle for post-processing. When false, transcription output is
  # written as-is without any cleanup. Set to true to enable the pipeline.
  enabled: false
  
  # Merge words that were hyphenated across line breaks (e.g., "politi-\nche"
  # becomes "politiche"). Uses conservative heuristics to avoid breaking
  # proper compound words like "Jean-Baptiste". Only merges when both sides
  # are lowercase word fragments. Recommended for OCR output from scanned books.
  merge_hyphenation: false
  
  # Collapse long runs of internal spaces (3+ spaces) between words down to
  # exactly 2 spaces. Helps clean up OCR artifacts while preserving some
  # spacing for tables and formatted content. Set to false to keep original spacing.
  collapse_internal_spaces: true
  
  # Maximum number of consecutive blank lines to keep in the output.
  # Extra blank lines beyond this limit are removed. Useful for cleaning up
  # excessive whitespace from OCR output. Set to 0 to remove all blank lines.
  max_blank_lines: 2
  
  # Number of spaces to expand each tab character into. Standard is 4.
  # Tabs are converted to spaces for consistent formatting across viewers.
  tab_size: 4
  
  # Enable line wrapping for very long lines. When true, lines exceeding the
  # wrap width are broken at word boundaries. Preserves leading indentation.
  # Headings, page markers, table rows, and error placeholders are never wrapped.
  wrap_lines: false
  
  # Automatically compute wrap width from the average line length of text blocks.
  # Only used when wrap_lines is true. Analyzes consecutive non-blank line groups
  # and uses their mean length as the target width. Useful when documents have
  # varying natural line lengths. Takes precedence over wrap_width if both set.
  auto_wrap: false
  
  # Explicit target width for line wrapping (in characters). Only used when
  # wrap_lines is true and auto_wrap is false. Set to null to use default of 80.
  # Common values: 80 (terminal), 100 (wide editor), 120 (modern screens).
  wrap_width: null
