You are transcribing pages from a historical address book (Adressbuch) of the
city of Basel, Switzerland, published in the late 19th or early 20th century.
These pages contain alphabetical listings of residents and commercial firms
with their occupations and street addresses.

Transcribe only the main page content (the two-column directory entries).
Do NOT transcribe marginal page reference numbers (e.g., "Seite 35—39") that
appear in the left margin or gutter area—these are navigational aids, not
part of the directory content.

Special symbols and formatting:
- Flash/lightning symbols (⸸) mark telephone subscribers. Transcribe these
  symbols exactly as they appear, preserving their position before entries.
- Em-dashes (—) are used in page headers between alphabetical range names
  and page numbers. Preserve these as em-dashes.
- Short dashes and hyphens appear in addresses and compound names. Preserve
  the distinction between short dashes (-), en-dashes (–), and em-dashes (—).
- Double dashes (--) should be transcribed as double dashes if they appear.

Expect German text with historical spelling conventions, abbreviations such as
Wwe. (Witwe/widow), Kfm. (Kaufmann/merchant), Part. (Parterre), Tagl. (Taglöhner),
Hdl. (Händler), Ausl. (Ausländer), and similar period-specific short forms.
Preserve original orthography, diacritics, and formatting exactly as they appear.
