The book bears the im-\nprimatur of the President and Censors of the College of Physicians.\nIt was reprinted in 1746.\n\n1656  THE PERFECT COOK.\nBeing the most exact directions for the making all kind of\nPastes, with the perfect way teaching how to Raise, Season,\nand make all sorts of Pies, Pasties, Tarts, and Florentines,\netc., now practised by the most famous and expert Cooks,\nboth French and English.\nAs also the perfect English Cook, or right method of the\nwhole Art of Cookery, with the true ordering of French,\nSpanish, and Italian Kickshaws, with Alamode varieties for\nPersons of Honour.\nTo which is added, the way of dressing all manner of Flesh,\nFowl, and Fish, and making admirable Sauces, after the\nmost refined way of French and English.\nThe like never extant ;\nWith fifty-five ways of dressing of Eggs.\nBy Mounsieur Marnette.\nPrinted at London for Nath. Brooks at the Angel in Cornhil,\n1656.\n\nThere is a frontispiece of two men and a woman in a kitchen,\nengraved by Ro. Vaughan. A later edition of 1686 has no frontis-\npiece, and probably this edition did not have one.\nFrom the preface we see that the author was born in London of\nforeign parents, and was \u2018turned young into the wild and Military\nWorld, to become a Son of Mars\u2019. After a time he returned to\nLondon and resigned himself \u2018to Minerva\u2019s milder tuition and pro-\ntection\u2019. He apologizes for presenting a book on pastry \u2018to this\nNation, where every Matron and young Damsel are so well vers\u2019d", "no_transcribable_text": false, "transcription_not_possible": false}}}

In it the author disparages\nprevious cookery books, \u2018the most of which nevertheless have\ninstructed rather how to marre than make good Meate.\u2019\n\nThe fifth edition was 1638, the sixth 1641, and the seventh 1650.\nThere are not many new recipes in the book. One pleasant one\nis \u2018To bake a Quince or a Warden pie, so as the fruit may be redde,\nand the crust pale and tender\u2019. At the very end is \u2018An excellent\nand much approved receit, for a long Consumption\u2019. It consists\nof white snails kept in wine and then boiled in milk with sugar.\n\u2018This being duely made and taken accordingly, will with God\u2019s\nhelp recover the party being very weake and farre spent in this\nlong lingering sicknesse.\u2019\n\n[^1]: See p. 2.\n\nC 2", "no_transcribable_text": false, "transcription_not_possible": false}}}
