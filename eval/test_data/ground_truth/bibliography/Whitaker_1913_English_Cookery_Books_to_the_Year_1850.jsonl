Superfluous hairs are removed by ‘Cats dung\nthat is hard and dryed, beaten to powder, and tempered with strong\nVinegar’. The recipe for ‘The Lady Gorings water for any Ague\nSicknesse or foulenesse in the Stomach, and to purge the Blood’ is,\n‘ Take the Dung of a Stone-Horse that is kept in the stable when\nit is new made, mingle it well with Beer and a little Ginger, and\na good quantity of Treacle, and distill it in an ordinary Still; Give\nof this a pretty draught to drink.’\n\t‘A Queens Delight’ is ‘The Art of Preserving, Conserving, and\nCandying’, but also contains some medical recipes. It tells how\n‘To make a Cake the way of the Royal Princess, the Lady Elizabeth\ndaughter to King Charles the first’, and how to make ‘Lorenoes’\nand ‘an Ipswitch Ball’. A mysterious thing is ‘A Receipt to make\nDamnable Hum’, unless one knows that hum was a sort of strong\nale, perhaps so named from the humming it caused in the head.\nA damnable hum must have been a drink of dangerous strength.\n\t‘The Compleat Cook’ contains such interesting recipes as ‘To\nmake a Devonshire white-pot’, ‘To make a Outlandish dish’ (hog’s\nliver seasoned with aniseed), ‘The Jacobins Pottage’, ‘To make\na Battalia Pye’, ‘To make a Stumpe Pye’, ‘The Contesse of\nRutlands Receipt of making the rare Banbury Cake, which was so\nmuch praised at her Daughters (the Lady Chaworths) wedding’,\n‘To make a fat Lambe of a Pig’, ‘To make poor Knights’.\n\n##**1655**  HEALTHS IMPROVEMENT:\n\nor, Rules Comprizing and Discovering the Nature, Method,\nand Manner of Preparing all sorts of food used in this nation.\nWritten by that ever Famous Thomas Muffett, Doctor in\nPhysick ; Corrected and Enlarged by Christopher Bennett,", "no_transcribable_text": false, "transcription_not_possible": false}
