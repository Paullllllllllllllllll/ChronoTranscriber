Newcomb for Samuel Thomson, at\nthe sign of the White Horse in Pauls Churchyard, 1655.\nThis is a very interesting book on the choice and preparation of\nfood by Thomas Muffett, who was born in 1553 and died in 1604.\nHe became M.P. for Wilton in 1597. The book bears the im-\nprimatur of the President and Censors of the Coll\u00e8ge of Physicians.\nIt was reprinted in 1746.\n\n1656 THE PERFECT COOK.\nBeing the most exact directions for the making all kind of\nPastes, with the perfect way teaching how to Raise, Season,\nand make all sorts of Pies, Pasties, Tarts, and Florentines,\netc., now practised by the most famous and expert Cooks,\nboth French and English.\nAs also the perfect English Cook, or right method of the\nwhole Art of Cookery, with the true ordering of French,\nSpanish, and Italian Kickshaws, with Alamode varieties for\nPersons of Honour.\nTo which is added, the way of dressing all manner of Flesh,\nFowl, and Fish, and making admirable Sauces, after the\nmost refined way of French and English.\nThe like never extant ;\nWith fifty-five ways of dressing of Eggs.\nBy Mounsieur Marnette.\nPrinted at London for Nath. Brooks at the Angel in Cornhil,\n1656.\nThere is a frontispiece of two men and a woman in a kitchen,\nengraved by Ro. Vaughan. A later edition of 1686 has no frontis-\npiece, and probably this edition did not have one.\nFrom the preface we see that the author was born in London of\nforeign parents, and was 'turned young into the wild and Military\nWorld, to become a Son of Mars'. After a time he returned to\nLondon and resigned himself 'to Minerva's milder tuition and pro-\ntection'. He apologizes for presenting a book on pastry 'to this\nNation, where every Matron and young Damsel are so well vers'd", "no_transcribable_text": false, "transcription_not_possible": false}}}
