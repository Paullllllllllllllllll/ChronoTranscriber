# PREFATORY NOTE

In a book called 'Notes from a Collector's Catalogue'[^1]
I gave a list of English cookery books to the year 1700,
with the name of the library in which each could be
found and a collation of the various editions. The present
list contains the title-pages of English books on cookery
and domestic economy to the year 1850.

I may repeat what was said in the former book, that
my real interest is not in cookery but in the combination
of cookery with medicine, which is found in most of
the early books, and which, continuing through the
first quarter of the nineteenth century, was gradually
destroyed by the growth of railways.

John and Edward Bumpus, 1909.

# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

**1500** THIS IS THE BOKE OF COKERY

Here beginneth a noble boke of festes royalle and Cokery a boke for a pryncis housholde or any other estates ; and the
makynge thereof as ye shall fynde more playinly within this boke.

Emprynted without temple barre by Richard Pynson in the vere of our lorde. M.D.

This title is given in Ames and Herbert,[^1] where it is stated that the Dowager Duchess of Portland brought the book
from Bulstrode to London for Herbert to examine.

A book called ' A noble booke of feastes royall, and of Cookerie, for Princes housholde, or any other estate, and the
making thereof ', is given by Maunsell [^2] as having been printed by John Byddell. This is doubtless the same book, and
the date would be between 1533 and 1540.

**1508** HERE BEYNNETH THE BOKE OF KERVYNGE.

This book is in the Cambridge Library. The colophon is ' Here endeth the boke of servyce and kervynge and sewynge and
all maner of offyce in his kynde unto a prynce or ony other estate and all the feestes in the yere. Emprynted by Wynkyn
de Worde at London in the Fletestrete at the sygne of the sonne. The yere of our lorde, M,CCCCC,VIII.'

The British Museum has a copy with the colophon, ' Here endeth the boke of servyce and kervynge and sewynge and all
maner of offyce in his kynde unto a prynce or ony other estate and all the feestes in the yere. Emprynted by Wynkyn de
Worde at London in Flete strete at the sygne of the sonne. The yere of our lorde god, M CCCCC XIII.'

Each of the above copies is a small quarto ; A with 6 leaves, B with 6. The book was reprinted by Abraham Veale (i.e.

[^2]: The first part of the Catalogue of English printed Bookes (1595).

between 1558 and 1586) as 'THE BOOKE OF CARVYNG ', and twice by
E. Allde as 'THE BOOKE OF CARVING AND SEWING ', the first edition
being without a date, the second dated 1613. These are each 12°;
the former A to C in eights, the latter two A to C₁ in eights.

The book was added in 1597 to 'The second part of the Good
Hus-wifes Jewell ', and in 1631 to John Murrell's 'Two bookes of
cookerie and carving '.

The book was edited for the Early English Text Society in 1868
by F. W. Furnivall.

It begins with a list of terms which are to be used by the carver,
e.g. Lyft that swanne, unlace that cony, dysplaye that crane,
dysfygure that pecocke, untache that curlew, alaye that fesande,
wynge that patryche, mynce that plover, and so on.

Later on the duties of the butler are laid down and a list of his
wines given, viz. Reed wyne, whyte wyne, clared wyne, osey, capricke,
campolet, renysche wyne, malvesey, bastarde, tyet, romney, mus-
cadell, clarrey, raspys, vernage wyne, cut, pymente, and ypocras.

The chamberlain's duties are strange. 'The chaumberlayne must
be dylygent & clenly in his offyce with his heed kembed & so to
his sovereyne that he be not reckeles & se that he have a clene
sherte breche petycote and doublet. . . . And at morne when your
soverayne wyll aryse warme his shert by the fyre.' After directions
as to dressing and washing his sovereign, the chamberlain is ordered
to 'take your leve manerly & go to the chyrche or chappell to your
sovereynes closet & laye carpentes & cuysshens & lay downe his
boke of prayers '. He is then to return and make the bed, '& bete
the federbedde & the bolster, but loke ye waste no feders.' After
this 'se the hous of hesement be swete & clene & the prevy borde
covered with a grene clothe and a cuysshyn '. Later on, after
putting the sovereign to bed, 'dryve out dogge or catte & loke
there be basyn and urynall set nere your sovereyne, then take your
leve manerly that your sovereyne may take his rest merly.'

The book ends with the duties of the marshal and the usher who
have to order the precedence of guests.

1539 THE TREASURE OF POORE MEN.

This little book of 44 leaves contains recipes for aqua vitae and
claret, but is mainly medical.

1539 THE CASTEL OF HELTHE,

gathered, and made by Sir Thomas Elyot knight, out of the
chief authors of Phisyke, whereby every man may knowe
the state of his owne body, the preservation of helthe, and
# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS 3

how to instruct well his phisition in sicknes, that he be not deceyed. MDXXXIX.

This is not a cookery book, but contains advice as to the uses and physical effects of different articles of diet.
According to the D.N.B. the author incurred the wrath of the physicians for encroaching on their domain.

## 1545 A PROPER NEWE BOOKE OF COKERYE,
declarynge what manner of meates be beste in season, for al times in the yere, and how they ought to be dressed, and
served at the table, both for fleshe dayes, and fyshe dayes. With a newe addition, verye necessarye for all them that
delyghteth in Cokerye.

The earliest known edition, which bears no date, is in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. It was printed
by ' John Kynge and Thomas Marche '. It is a small book of 16 leaves ; A to B in eights, P₈ blank. A reprint has
recently been edited by Miss C. F. Frere.

Ames and Herbert (iii. 256) give an edition of 1545, printed with Richard Lant, and Hazlitt gives one of 1546, printed
by Richard Lant and Richard Bankes.

The British Museum has editions of 1575 (printed by William How for Abraham Veale) and of 1576 (printed for Antony
Kytson).

Maunsell gives 'A LITTLE OLDE BOOKE OF COOKERIE', printed by Antony Kytson, and Ames and Herbert (iii. 571) give ' A
NEWE BOKE OF COOKERY ', printed by Thomas Raynald. Perhaps these are editions of the same book, but the latter would be
an early edition between 1540 and 1550.

Some of the recipes are strange—A tart of Bourage Flowers, A pye of aloes (not so alarming as it seems from the title),
A tart of Marygoldes, Primroses, or Cowslips, A tart of Spinaige, To make egges in mone shine.

## 1558 THE SECRETES OF THE REVERENDE MAISTER ALEXIS OF PIEMONT.

Containyng excellente remedies against divers diseases, woundes, and other accidents, with the manner to make
distillations, parfumes, confitures, diynges, colours, fusions and meltynges. A worke well approved, verye profytable

and necessary for every man.  Translated out of French
into English, by Wylliam Warde.
Imprynted at London by John Kingstone for Nicolas
Inglande, dwellinge in Poules Churchyarde.  Anno 1558.
Mess. Novemb.

This contains recipes for making ipocras, confitures, &c.

1562  Here foloweth A COMPEDYOUS REGYMENT OR
A DYETARY OF HELTH, made in Moñtpylior :
compiled by Andrewe Boorde, of Physicke Doctor.

The earliest edition has no date, the next is dated 1562.  This
book, like Elyot's Castle of Health, is not a cookery book, but
gives advice as to the use of food.  The author was a man of most
varied experiences, not always reputable though he had once been
a bishop.

1573  THE TREASURIE OF COMMODIOUS CON-
CEITES, AND HIDDEN SECRETS.

Commonly called The Good Huswives Closet of provision
for the health of her household.

Meete and necessarie for the profitable use of all estates,
gathered out of sundry Experiments lately practised by men
of great knowledge.

The earliest known copy has lost its title-page, but the colophon
is, 'These Bookes are to be sould at the West ende of Paules Church :
By Richard Jones, the Printer hereof, 1573.'  It is a small 12° book.

The British Museum has an edition of 1584, 'the fourth tyme
corrected and inlayed, with divers necessary and new editions,' and
one of 1586.  The Bodleian has an edition of 1591, and Hazlitt
mentions editions of 1580, 1586, 1594, and 1596.

The book is by John Partridge, of whose history nothing seems
known, and it cost four pence.  It is dedicated to 'Master Richard
Wistow, one of the Assistants of the Companie of the Barbers and
Surgeons'.

One of the most striking features of the book is the number of
conserves it gives and their virtues.  Thus the conserve of straw-
berries is 'good against a hote liver, burning of the stomacke, and
specially in the fervent heat of an ague', the conserve of buglosse
flowers 'comforteth the hote heart ', the conserve of borage flowers
ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS  5

'is especially good against black choller or Melancholic, it also maketh
one merie '.
    There are recipes for a ' powdeer to make the belly soluble, causing
a gentle laske '; a ' meete for Noble personages ', ' To make the face
fayre and the breath sweete ', ' To make haire as yellow as gold ',
' To make Manus Christi '.
    The book next appears as a quarto with a somewhat different title :

**THE TREASURIE OF HIDDEN SECRETS.**

Commonlie called, The good-huswives Closet of provision,
for the health of her Houshold.
    Gathered out of sundry experiments, lately practised by men
of great knowledge : And now newly enlarged, with divers
necessary Phisicke helpes, and knowledge of the names
and natural disposition of diseases, that most commonly
happen to men and women.
    Not impertinent for every good Huswife to use in her house,
amongst her owne familie.
    At London, printed by J R for Edward White, and are
to be sold at his shop at the little North doore of Paules,
at the signe of the Gunne, 1600.
    It is a thin quarto, A to I in fours. It was reprinted twice in
1627 and again in 1633, 1637, and 1653. Professor Ferguson gives
an edition of 1656.

**1574 A DIRECTION FOR THE HEALTH OF MAGIS-**
**TRATES AND STUDENTES.**

Namely such as bee in their consistent Age, or neere there-
unto : Drawn as well out of sundry good and commendable
Authours, as also upon reason and faithfull experience
otherwise certaynely grounded. Written in Latin by
Gulielmus Gratarolus, and Englished by T. N.
    Imprinted at London, in Fleete streete, by William How,
for Abraham Veale, 1574.
    This is not a cookery book, but merely contains advice as to the
use of food. Gratarolus was an Italian who was compelled to leave
his country on account of his having embraced the Calvinist faith.
<page_number>6</page_number> ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

He practised physic at Bâle, and died in 1568. Thomas Newton, the translator, was Rector of Little Ilford.

1582 A COMPENDIUM OF THE RATIONALL SECRETES

into three Bookes.
In the first is shewed many secretes apperteinyng unto Phisicke.
In the seconde is shewed many secretes apperteining unto Chirurgerie, with their uses.
In the third is shewed divers compositions, apperteinyng bothe to Phisicke and Chirurgerie, with the hidden vertues of
sondrie vegitables, anumalles, and mineralls, and proved wel by this Authour, hetherto never set out before.
Imprinted at London by Jhon Kyngston, for George Pen and I. H., 1582.

Fioravante died at Bologna in 1588. The translator of the book was John Hester of whom there is an account in the D. N.
B. The cookery receipts are in Book III. Curious pieces of information are given, e.g. 'Take a Capon and pull awaie all
his feathers from his breastie, and beate hym with Nettles, and he will call in the young Chickens, and governe them
like the Henne.'

1583 THE SCHOOLEMASTER
or Teacher of Table Philosophie. A most pleasant and merie Companion, well worthy to be welcomed (for a dayly Gheast)
not onelye to all mens hoorde, to guide them with moderate and holsome dyet ; but also into every mans Companie at all

pastyme.
Gathered out of divers, the best approved Auctbors :

mirth while we be at meate or at any other time.
The fourth Booke of Table Philosophie which compriseth many merry honest Jestes, delectable devyses and pleasant
purposes, to be for delight and recreation at the board among Company.
    This book was written by Thomas Twyne, a doctor of Lewes, or Thomas Turswell, a Canon of St. Paul's.  The D.N.B.
    suggests that the 'honest Jestes' were hardly such as could be dedicated by a canon to his dean.  The D.N.B.
    mentions an edition of 1576.

1585 (?)  THE GOOD HUSWIFES JEWELL.
Wherein is to be found most excellent and rare Devises for conceites in Cookery, found out by the practise of Thomas
Dawson.
Whereunto is adjoyned sundry approved receits for many soveraine oyles, and the way to distill many precious waters,
with divers approved medicines for many diseases.

    This is a 12° of 52 leaves.  The head-line is 'A Booke of Cookerie'.  No earlier edition than 1596 seems known.
    Watt mentions an undated edition, and Hazlitt one of 1610.  The book was reprinted
<page_number>8</page_number> ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

in 1620 under the title of 'A Booke of Cookerie'. The book tells
one how 'To make muggets', 'To make a mortis', 'To make
a Blewmanger'. A cure for obesity is likely to do quite as much
good as the modern quack remedies. 'To make one slender. Take
Fennell, and seeth it in Water, a very good quantity, and wringing
out the juyce thereof when it is sodde, drink it first and last, and it
shall swage either man or woman.'

WIFES JEWELL,

French maner.
Never the like published by any untill this present yere, 1585.
Imprinted at London for Edward White, dwelling at the little
North doore of Paules Church, at the signe of the Gunne.

Another edition of 1597 has added to it 'The Book of Carving'.
Maunsell gives an edition of 1590, and Hazlitt one of 1606. The
book is similar to the first part and has 72 pages. The head-line
is 'A Booke of Cookerie'. In the 1597 edition, 'The Booke of Carving
and Sewing' has a separate title-page and is unpaged.

There are recipes 'To make Purses or Cremitaries',—this begins
'Take a little Mary—' 'To make Jombrils', 'To make a Colluce',
'To make a Condonacke'.

1586 THE OLDE MANS DIETARIE.

A worke no lesse learned then necessary for the preservation
of Olde persons in perfect health and soundnesse.
Englished out of Latine, and now first published by Thomas
Newton.
Imprinted at London for Edward White, dwelling at the
little North-doore of Sainct Paules Church, at the signe of
the Gun. 1586.

This book, like the one of Gratarolus which Newton also trans-
lated, is not a cookery book, but gives advice as to the use of foods.

ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS <page_number>II</page_number>

THE GOOD HUSVVIVES HANDMAID, FOR COOKERIE
in her Kitchin, &c.

The book under this title in the B.M. is the same as the last. It has lost its title-page, and A₂ and the name has been

1595 THE WIDDOWES TREASURE.
Plentifully furnished with sundry precious and approved secrets in Phisicke and Chirurgery, for the health and pleasure

In a preface signed M. R. the book is said to have been written 'at the earnest request and sute of a Gentlewoman in the
Country for her private use, which by these singular practices hath obtained such fame, that her name shall bee
remembered for ever to the Posterity '. In spite of the preface it is difficult to believe that a gentlewoman could have
treated or even described so plainly some of the diseases mentioned. The book has no arrangement of subjects. Thus five
consecutive recipes are, 'To keepe Venison from rotting ', 'To keepe Peares ', 'To kill Lice ', 'Against drunkenesse',
'To make Linnen Cloth, or Yarne white '. A recipe for 'Diatrion Piperion ', made of pepper, time, ginger, aniseeds, &c.,
moves the author or authoress to poetry.

Virtutis hujus confectionis sequuntur.
This decoction is good to eate
    alwaies before and after meate.
For it will make digestion good,
    and turne your meate to pure blood.

1595 (?) A THOUSAND NOTABLE THINGS
of sundry sorts, &c.

This book, by Thomas Lupton, is almost entirely medical. There
are many editions of it, one as late as 1815. The earliest, undated
but about 1595, was 'imprinted at London by John Charlewood,
for Hughe Spooner, dwelling in Lumbardstreete at the signe of the
Cradle'.

1598 EPULARIO,

There is a recipe 'To make pies that the Birds may be alive in
them, and flie out when it is cut up', and another horrid one 'To

Non nobis solum nati sumus, sed ortus nostri sibi vendicant. Printed in London by Tho. Creede, for William Wood, and are
to be sold at the West end of Powles, at the signe of Tyme, 1599.

This is not a cookery book, but a description of different articles of food on one side of the page and a 'story for
table-talke' about each on the other. Some of the stories could certainly not be told at modern dinner-tables. There is
an account of the author in Masters's History of Corpus Christi College. Buttes was elected master of the college in
1626 and vice-chancellor in 1629, 'He being to preach before the university as vice-chancellor on Easter-day, April 1.
1632, was found hanging in his garters in his own chamber.' There is a portrait of him in the master's lodge. Lowndes
states that there is a portrait of him in Harding's Biographical Mirror, but this seems to be a mistake.

1600 NATURALL AND ARTIFICIAL DIRECTIONS

for health, derived from the best Philosophers, as well moderne, as auncient.

By William Vaughan, Master of Artes, and Student in the Civill Law.

London, printed by Richard Bradocke, 1600.

Part of this book is on the use of foods. The author, who lived from 1577 to 1641, helped to colonize Newfoundland. 1602
(2), 1607 (3), 1617 (5), 1626 (6), 1633 (7).

1600 (?) DELIGHTS FOR LADIES,

To adorne their Persons, Tables, Closets, and Distillatories ;
with Beauties, Banquets, Perfumes, & Waters.

Reade, Practice, & Censure.

At London, printed by Peter Short.

A most charming little book within borders, in some of which are woven the initials E R. It consists of A to H in

1609, 1611, 1615, 1630, 1632, 1636. Later editions, 1647, 1651, 1654, 1656, 1683, are printed without the borders.
Hazlitt gives editions of 1600, 1603, 1618, 1640. Hugh Plat, the son of a London brewer, was born in 1552, and knighted
in 1605 as a reward for his literary efforts.

ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

The recipes seem as charming as the book itself. 'The most kindly waie to preserve plums', 'To make a paste to keepe you
moist, if you list not to drinke oft, which Ladies use to carry with them when they ride abrosd', 'To candie Orange
pilles', 'To make a cullis as white as snowe, and in the nature of gellie', 'Usquebash or Irish Aqua vitae', 'a Scottish
handwater'.

**1607** THE ENGLISHMAN'S DOCTER, OR THE SCHOOLE OF SALERNE,

or, Physical observations for the perfect Preserving of the body of Man in continuall Health.

London: Printed for John Helme, and John Busby Junior, and are to be solde at the little shoppe, next Clifford's Inne
gate, in Fleet-streete. 1607.

This is the earliest translation of the famous Latin poem said to have been written by the physicians of Salerno for the
preservation of the health of Robert, eldest son of William the Conqueror. The commentary, written by Arnaldus de Villa
Nova, who died about 1313, was translated as early as 1528 by T. Paynell. The poem is concerning the use of foods. Among
other editions there is one of 1634 'whereunto is annexed a necessary Discourse of all sorts of Fish in use among us,
with their effects, appertayning to the health of Man'.

**1608** A CLOSET FOR LADIES AND GENTLEWOMEN,

or, The Art of preserving, Conserving, and Candying.

With the manner howe to make divers kinds of Syrups: and all kind of banqueting stuffes.

Also divers soveraigne Medicines and Salves, for sundry Diseases.

At London, printed for Arthur Johnson, dwelling neere the great North dore of Pauls, 1608.

12°; A to M in eights; pages 1–190. A little book within borders, much resembling 'Delightes for Ladies' by Plat, to
whom the book is attributed in the Dounce catalogue, but it looks more like a rival work.

The book was reprinted in 1611, and again in 1630, 1632, and 1636 with different borders. An edition of 1647 has a
portrait of a lady as frontispiece, but no borders. Later editions of 1651, 1654,
# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS <page_number>15</page_number>

and 1656 have a table of contents, but no portrait and no borders.
Hazlitt gives an edition of 1635. This book contains many tempting
recipes. 'To make a Walnut, that when you cracke it, you shall
find Biskets, and Carrawayes in it, or a prettie Posey written.'
'To make an excellent Marmelate which was given Queene Mary
for a New-yeares gift.' 'To make another sort of Marmelate very
comfortable and restorative for any Lord or Lady whatsoever.'
The following seems to be the remedy of the day for appendicitis.
'For one that is taken within the body, or any place. Take Rose
cakes, aqua-vitae, and rose water, heate it on a chafindish of coales,
lay it to the stomacke, they shall mend by God's grace.'

## 1614 THE PHILOSOPHERS BANQUET ;

many severall Dishes, that in the former Service were

as much more. By W. B. Esquire.
London, printed by T. C. for Leonard Becket, and are to bee
solde at his shoppe in the Temple, neere the Church. 1614.

The first edition of this book was entered in the Stationers'
Register of May 29, 1609, but no copy is known. The book, which
is on the uses of foods and on many other topics, is famous for
being the first to contain a quotation from Hamlet. The third
edition was printed for Nicholas Vavasour in 1633. The original,
Mensa Philosophica, of which the first known edition is 1475, has
been ascribed both to Sir Michael Scott and to Theobald Anguilbert,
an Irish physician. According to a note in one of Sotheby's cata-
logues W. B. was probably the same person who published the
'Court of Good Counsel' in 1607, 'A Help to Discourse' in 1619,
and a paraphrase of the tenth satire of Juvenal in 1617. Part of
'A Help to Discourse' is from 'The Philosophers Banquet'.

streete, 1615.

This is the second book of 'Country Contentments', by Gervase
Markham, who was born about 1568 and died in 1637. He has
been called 'the earliest English hackney writer'. Other editions
are 1623, 1631 (4), 1637 (5), 1648, 1649, 1656 (6), 1660 (7), 1664,
1668 (8), 1675, 1683 (9). An edition of 1653 was reprinted by
Constance, Countess De La Warr, in 1907.

The cookery recipes seem more modern than those of preceding
books, although many of the dishes are obsolete, e.g. leach and
jumbal. The medical recipes, however, are appalling, animal dung
and other filth being frequent ingredients.

1617 A DAILY EXERCISE FOR LADIES AND
GENTLEWOMEN.

Whereby they may learne and practise the whole Art of
making Pastes, Preserves, Marmalades, Conserves, Tart-

The book (A to H₈ in eights, A₁ being blank) begins with the various courses at a feast. Some recipes seem new, e.g. 'To
smoore an old Coney, Ducke, or Mallard on the French fashion', 'To make Pancakes so crispe that you may set them
upright', 'A sallet of rose-buds and clove gily-flowers', 'A fierced pudding', 'A fond pudding'.

By John Murrell Professor thereof.
London, printed for Tho. Dewe, and are to be sold at his
shoppe in St. Dunstons Church-yard in Fleete-street, 1621.

In the course of his preface 'To all ladies and gentlewomen, and
others whatsoever', the author speaks of this book as 'an Addition
to my former practise which I did attaine unto in my travels when
I was in France, Italy, the Low-Countries, and divers other places'.
He speaks of his craft as 'Art and Mistery'.

The book is printed within borders. The first part of it is A to
G₁ in twelves, A, being blank; there are one or two misprints,
e. g. A instead of B. The book of cookery has a separate title-page,
and consists of A with 8 leaves, B with 12, C with 5; it is a reprint
of the edition of 1617.

The recipes of the 'Delightful Daily Exercise' are much like those
of the 'Daily Exercise'. 'To sucket candy greene Lemons, a very
cordial thing for the Stomacke'; 'To make Premellies', 'To make
Oring chipps, a very cordial thing against the paine or wind in the
stomacke'; 'To fry an egge as round as a ball'. There are plans
of how sweets are to be arranged on the table.

Each book has its separate title-page, and at the end is 'A New
Booke of Carving and Sewing';' which also has its own title-page.
The preface is dated July 20, 1630. In it the author disparages
previous cookery books, 'the most of which nevertheless have
instructed rather how to marre than make good Meate.'

The fifth edition was 1638, the sixth 1641, and the seventh 1650.
There are not many new recipes in the book. One pleasant one
is 'To bake a Quince or a Warden pie, so as the fruit may be redde,
and the crust pale and tender'. At the very end is 'An excellent
and much approved receit, for a long Consumption'. It consists
of white snails kept in wine and then boiled in milk with sugar.
'This being duely made and taken accordingly, will with God's
help recover the party being very weake and farre spent in this
long lingering sicknessse.'

     This is a quarto of 4 leaves with a few cookery recipes. It is
reprinted in a book of the same date by Salvator Winter[^1] of Naples
and Francisco Dickinson, and ascribed to Dickinson.  All three were
quacks who at the end of their books advertised their residence
and their ability to 'pull out all manner of Hollow Teeth, stumps
or roots, with great dexterity and ease, without almost any paine '.

1652  A HERMETICALL BANQUET,
drest by a Spagircall Cook: for the better Preservation of
the Microcosme.
     London, printed for Andrew Crooke, and are to be sold at

been issued together, though the pagination is distinct and occa-

ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS  23

sionally one book is seen without the other. The lettering of the
sheets is also distinct in the first edition and in one imprint of
sheets is also distinct in the first edition and in one imprint of
the second edition, but in other editions it is continuous. The book
is a small octavo in size; A with 4 leaves, B to F₃ in twelves,
followed by A with 4 leaves, B to E₄ in twelves. The copy in the
British Museum looks of much later date than subsequent editions,
which are of a small duodecimo size, but there was a Roger Norton
printer from 1639 to 1662, so that it is difficult to regard it as
a reprint. The second edition was 1653, of which there are two
imprints. Other editions are 1658 (10), 1659 (11), 1661, 1663 (14),
1667 (15), 1682 (18), 1687 (19), 1708. Professor Ferguson gives the
4th edition as 1654, and the 12th as 2659 (*sic*). He also notes an
edition of 1656.

There is a portrait of the Countess of Kent as frontispiece to all
the editions except the first, and it may be mentioned that the
book is catalogued under her name, Elizabeth Grey, in the British
Museum. She was second daughter of Gilbert Talbot, Earl of
Shrewsbury, and wife of Henry de Grey, Earl of Kent. She died
at Whitefriars on December 7, 1751.[^1]

The first book is purely medical, and recommends the usual filthy
remedies, e.g. the dung of a peacock for convulsions and powdered
earthworms for jaundice. It gives 'A cordiall for the Sea. Take one
ounce of Sirupe of Clove-gilliflowers, one drachm of Confectio Alcher-
mes, one ounce and a half of Borrage water, and the like of Mint-water,
one ounce of Mr. Mountfords water, and as much of Cinnamon-water,
temper all these together in a Cordial, and take a spoonful at a time
when you are at sea'. The second book is the cookery part, and
tells how to make a slipcoat Cheese, Angellets, fine Diet-bread,
Essings, Ponado, Bonny Clutter, Lady of Arundels Manchet, &c.

**1653  THE FRENCH COOK.**

Englished by I. D. G.
London, printed for Charles Adams, and are to be sold at
his Shop, at the Sign of the Talbot neere St. Dunstans
Church in Fleetstreet, 1653.

This is a translation of *Le Cuisinier françois*, which ran through
many editions in the original. There is a frontispiece representing
a cook in his kitchen. The second edition (1654) also contains it,
but it is omitted in the third [^1] (1673), which is of larger size than
the previous editions. This is the first cookery book which has
any order and arrangement in its contents.

Contra vim mortis, non est medicamen in hortis.
London, printed by M. S. for Tho. Jenner at the South
entrance of the Royall Exchange, London, 1653.

This is a small quarto of 49 pages. The last two pages are wrongly
put as 50, 51 in one of the British Museum copies, but are correct
in the other. There was an edition of 1656 sold at Sotheby's a few
years ago. The contents of the book are curiously arranged. There
is first an engraving of the fruit or flower, and then follow recipes
both in medicine and cookery which contain it. Thus the first
engraving is of a lemon, and among the recipes are 'a lemmon
sallet', 'Past of lemmons', 'To take away the Spots, or red Pimpels
of the face', 'Sweet Dagges to lay amongst Linnen', 'To roste
a Shoulder of Mutton with *Lemmons*'.

1654 THE ART OF COOKERY.
Refin'd and Augmented, containing an Abstract of some
rare and rich unpublished Receipts of Cookery : Collected
from the practice of that incomparable Master of these Arts,
Mr. Jos. Cooper, chiefe Cook to the late King : With severall
other practises by the Author, with an addition of Preserves,
Conserves, &c., offering an infallible delight to all Judicious
Readers.
London, printed by F. G. for R. Lowndes at the White-lyon
in St. Paul's Church-yard, neer the West end, 1654.

The preface says that the title-pages of some cookery books, 'like
the contents of a weekly Pamphlet, promised much more than the
Books performed,' but the only thing likely to displease ladies in
this book 'will be to see so many uncommon, and undeflour'd
Receipts prostituted to the publique view, which might perchance
. . . have been plac'd better among the paper-secrets in a few of
your Cabinets'.

There are recipes to 'fry Skerroots', 'make a Paris-pie', 'a Pie
answerble to the grand boyled meat, with 10 other pies belonging
to the first'.

1654 THE LADIES COMPANION,
or, A Table furnished with sundry sorts of Pies and Tarts,
gracefull at a Feast, with many excellent receipts for Pre-
serving, Conserving, and Candying of all manner of fruits,

by W. Bentley, and are to be sold by W. Shears, at the sign of the Bible, in S. Pauls Church yard, 1654.

The peculiarity of this little book of 82 pages is that names are attached to most of the recipes, e.g. Mrs. Medgate's
Broth, Mrs. Heyden's White Broth, Mrs. Atkinson's Pudding for Fridays, The Lady Butler's Cream of Almonds, The Lady
Goring's Sullybub, The Lady Throgmorton's Egg Pie.

1655 THE QUEENS CLOSET OPENED, Incomparable Secrets in Physick, Chirurgery, Preserving and Candying, and Cookery ; as
they were presented to the Queen, By the most experienced Persons of our Times, many whereof were honoured with her own
practice, when she pleased to descend to these more private Recreations. Never before published.

Transcribed from the true Copies of her Majesties own Receipt Books, by W. M., one of her late servants.

Vivit post funera Virtus.

Printed for Nathaniel Brook at the Angel in Cornhill, 1655.

This consists of three books, 'THE PEARLE OF PRACTICE', 'A QUEENS DELIGHT', and 'THE COMPLEAT COOK', the last two having
separate title-pages, 'THE COMPLEAT COOK', nearly always separately paged, was sometimes published by itself. The other
two, though sometimes separately paged, seem to have been nearly always published together.

There is a portrait of Henrietta Maria Regina by Gulielmus Faithorne as frontispiece.

Other editions are 1656, 1661, 1662, 1668, 1671, 1674, 1679, 1683, 1684, 1696 (10), 1710 (1), 1713 (II). In the British
Museum the book is catalogued under W. M.

A 1659 edition of 'The Compleat Cook' was probably issued by itself, as the lettering of the sheets begins with A. One
of 1664 begins with N.

The dates on the title-pages of the second and third books do not always correspond with the date of the first
title-page.

The preface to the first edition begins, 'The Queens Closet opened,

and is W. M. In other editions the success of the book calls on the
author to give it 'a new birth', i.e. a new preface. W. M., when
age will not suffer him 'to remain much longer in this troublesome
world', claims to have transcribed these receipts into the Queen's
own book.

'The Pearle of Practice' is medical, and equals, if it does not
exceed, any of its predecessors. For 'a special water for a consump-
tion' there are used a peck of snails, a quart of earthworms, and
three gallons of strong ale. 'The soiling of a Dog that is hard and
white, mixed with honey' is recommended as an outward applica-
tion to the throat. Superfluous hairs are removed by 'Cats dung
that is hard and dryed, beaten to powder, and tempered with strong
Vinegar'. The receipt for an 'Ague Sickness or foulnesse in the Stomach, and to purge the Blood' is,
'Take the Dung of a Stone-Horse that is kept in the stable when
it is new made, mingle it well with Beer and a little Ginger, and
a good quantity of Treacle, and distill it in an ordinary Still; Give
of this a pretty draught to drink.'

'A Queens Delight' is 'The Art of Preserving, Conserving, and
Candying'; but also contains some medical recipes. It tells how
'To make a Cake the way of the Royal Princess, the Lady Elizabeth
daughter to King Charles the first', and how to make 'Lorenes'
and 'an Ipswith Ball'. A mysterious thing is 'A Receipt to make
Damnable Hum', unless one knows that hum was a sort of strong
ale, perhaps so named from the humming it caused in the head.
A damnable hum must have been a drink of dangerous strength.

'The Compleat Cook' contains such interesting recipes as 'To
make a Devonshire white-pot', 'To make a Outlandish dish' (hog's
liver seasoned with aniseed), 'The Jacobins Pottage', 'To make
a Battalia Pye', 'To make a Stumpe Pye', 'The Countesse of
Rutlands Receipt of making the rare Banbury Cake, which was so
much praised at her Daughters (the Lady Chaworths) wedding',
'To make a fat Lambe of a Pig', 'To make poor Knights'.

1655 HEALTHS IMPROVEMENT:
or, Rules Comprising and Discovering the Nature, Method,
and Manner of Preparing all sorts of food used in this nation.
Written by that ever Famous Thomas Muffett, Doctor in
Physick; Corrected and Enlarged by Christopher Bennett,
28  ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

Doctor in Physick, and Fellow of the Collège of Physicians
in London.
London, printed by Tho. Newcomb for Samuel Thomson, at
the sign of the White Horse in Pauls Churchyard, 1655.
This is a very interesting book on the choice and preparation of
food by Thomas Muffett, who was born in 1553 and died in 1604.
He became M.P. for Wilton in 1597. The book bears the im-
primatur of the President and Censors of the Collège of Physicians.
It was reprinted in 1746.

1656 THE PERFECT COOK.
Being the most exact directions for the making all kind of
Pastes, with the perfect way teaching how to Raise, Season,
and make all sorts of Pies, Pasties, Tarts, and Florentines,
etc., now practised by the most famous and expert Cooks,
both French and English.
As also the perfect English Cook, or right method of the
whole Art of Cookery, with the true ordering of French,
Spanish, and Italian Kickshaws, with Alamode varieties for
Persons of Honour.
To which is added, the way of dressing all manner of Flesh,
Fowl, and Fish, and making admirable Sauces, after the
most refined way of French and English.
The like never extant ;
With fifty-five ways of dressing of Eggs.
By Mounsieur Marnette.
Printed at London for Nath. Brooks at the Angel in Cornhil,
1656.
There is a frontispiece of two men and a woman in a kitchen,
engraved by Ro. Vaughan. A later edition of 1686 has no frontis-
piece, and probably this edition did not have one.
From the preface we see that the author was born in London of
foreign parents, and was 'turned young into the wild and Military
World, to become a Son of Mars'. After a time he returned to
London and resigned himself 'to Minerva's milder tuition and pro-
tection'. He apologizes for presenting a book on pastry 'to this
Nation, where every Matron and young Damsel are so well vers'd
ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS  29

in the Pastry Art, as that they may out-vie the best Forreign Pastry
Cooks in all the World besides '.
The book seems to be the one mentioned in London's Catalogue
of the most vendible books (1657) as ' The French and English
cooke, for exact making all sorts of pasts, pasties, Florentines, &c.
ordering of French, Spanish, and Italian kickshawes, dressing, flesh,
fowle, and fish ; with admirable sawces 12° '.
The first part of the book is a translation of *Le Pastissier françois*,
which was published in 1653. An Amsterdam edition of 1655 has
the same frontispiece as the English edition and the original of its
preface. There are recipes for making Chossons, Flawns, Rattoones,
Darioles, Poupelains, Tourrons, buttered Wiggs, Gamby Bisket, and
the good Wives Tart or a Tart for a friend in a corner, all of which
seem very good. The 55 ways of dressing eggs include ' an Omelet
according to the newest mode, Oxford Gates, or the Covent Garden
guise '.

Magistro Artis, Edere est Esse.

their shop at the Middle-Temple-Gate, in Fleet-street, 1658.

Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne was born at Mayerne, near
Geneva, in 1573. He came to London in 1606, and was appointed
physician first to the queen and then to the king. He died at
Chelsea in 1655. Most, if not all, of the recipes are copied from
earlier books. The compiler, who doubtless invented the fiction of
a Mayerne manuscript, in a learned preface quotes Plato and Plautus.

the Angel in Cornhill, 1660.

Other editions are 1665 (2), 1671 (3), of which there are two
imprints, 1678 (4), 1685 (5).

As frontispiece there is a portrait with 'Ætatis Suæ 71, 1660'
in background, and beneath are the lines :

What ! wouldst thou view but in one face
all hospitalitie, the race
of those that for the Gusto stand,
whose tables a whole Ark comand
of Nature's plentie, wouldst thou see
this sight, peruse May's booke, tis hee.
Ja. Parry

For Nathaniell Brooke, att the Angell in Cornhill.

According to Granger (Biog. Hist. iv. 68) the portrait is by Gaywood.
Southey quotes the title-page in Omniana, ii. 70.

There are two poems at the beginning in May's honour, and a story
of his life which mentions that he was the son of a cook and was
trained in France. This training accounts for his giving nine recipes
for preparing snails and one for baking frogs. In the preface May
says that 'God and my own Conscience would not permit me to
bury these my Experiences in the Grave', and that 'The Queens
Closet Opened' was the only book comparable to his own.

London, printed by R. W. for Giles Calvert, at the sign of the black Spread Eagle, at the West end of Pauls, 1661.

This book is by William Rabisha, who describes himself as ' Master Cook to many honourable Families before and since the
wars began, both in this my Native Country, and with Ambassadors and other Nobles in certain forraign patts '.

Other editions are 1673, 1675 (2). Watt gives one of 1682. The editions of 1661 and 1673 are in the Bodleian, but not in
the B.M.
There is a long poem in commendation of the author, two of the lines being:

> His Broths, Pottages, to the taste and sight,
> Would Esau-like, make some to sell their right.

It is a well-arranged book, giving recipes ' to pickle Sleep-at-noon ', to make ' Punnado ' and ' Andolians ', ' to fry
Primrose-leaves in March with eggs ', ' to Spitchcoch an Eel '. Near the end are ' Certain old useful Traditions of
Carving and Sewing, &c.' which come from the ' Book of Carving ' of 1508, and a dreadful recipe ' to roast a shoulder of
Mutton in blood '.

and at Tho. Milbourns, Printer, in Jewen 'street near
Aldersgate-Street : Who also sells for her, a most excellent
Cordial-Powder, and very soveraign Pils,
London, printed by Tho. Milbourn for the Authress 1661.

There is another edition of 1662, which has a frontispiece repre-
senting a lady and her cook in a kitchen.

This is the first book by this authoress, who, according to the
D. N. B., was married at the age of 24 to one Woolley, who had
been master of the free school at Newport, and was married in 1666
to a Francis Challinor, of St. Margaret's, Westminster. Granger
(Biog. Hist. v. 308) expresses doubt as to the real authorship of
the books ascribed to her. In the preface she speaks of 'this little
Book, which though but little, containeth more than all the books
that ever I saw Printed in this Nature, they being rather Con-
founders than Instructers'.

1663 A BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE

In three parts, &c., &c.

Composed by Samuel Strangchopes.

London, printed for Charles Tyns, at the 'three Bibles on
London-Bridge, 1663.

recipes.

London, printed for Peter Dring at the Sun in the Poultry,

The authoress says in her preface, 'I would not willingly dye
while I live, nor be quite forgotten when I am dead ; therefore
ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS 33

have I sent forth This book, to testify to the scandalous World that I do not altogether spend my Time idlely.'

1664 THE COURT & KITCHEN
of Elizabeth, Commonly called Joan Cromwel, The Wife of the late Usurper, Truly Described and Represented, And now made
Publick for General Satisfaction. London, printed by Tho. Milbourn, for Randal Taylor in St. Martins Le Grand, 1664.

A manuscript note in the B. M. copy says there should be a print as frontispiece. The paging and the lettering of the
sheets are both irregular.

A long and learned introduction, quoting Epictetus and Plato, is an attack on the family of Cromwell, but its object
must have been to act as an advertisement of the book, which is nothing but an ordinary cookery book. The recipes are
introduced by this preface, ' Here followes the most usual Meat and Diet observed at her Table, most of them ordinary
and vulgar, except some few Rarities, but such as arrided her Palate and Expence, of which it will be no unpleasing
Labour to the Reader, to peruse the Cookery, and manner of Dressing, as also her Preserves, &c.' Two recipes have a
definite personal reference attached, ' How to make Scotch Collops of Veal (this was almost her constant Dish) ', ' How
to make Marrow Puddings (which she usually had to her Breakfast) '.

(1664) THE GENTLEWOMANS CABINET UNLOCKED,

Wherein is contained many excellent Receipts for neat Dressing of divers sorts of Meats ; as Flesh and Fish, with their
Proper Sauces. Also Directions for the best way of making

Pancakes } Puddings } (And such Fritters } Custards } like fine Tansies } Cheesecakes } Knacks.

And other Delicate Dishes, which are most frequently used in Gentlemens Houses.

Passenger succeeded to the business of Charles Tyas, his former master in 1664. Thackeray was in business in 1666.
