At the bottom of the page, a new bibliographic entry begins for the year 1655, titled 'HEALTHS IMPROVEMENT' by Thomas Muffett, with a subtitle in italics. The text uses roman type for the main body and italics for the book subtitle at the bottom. The transcription adheres to the original line breaks, archaic spellings (e.g., 'breaths', 'Physick', 'Ipswitch'), and punctuation.", "transcription": "ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS <page_number>27</page_number>\n\nTo those Persons of Honour and Quality, that presented many of\nthese admirable Receipts at the feet of the Queens Majesty, the\nPublisher resigns them with his prostrate service whilst he breaths,\nand is W. M.' In other editions the success of the book calls on the\nauthor to give it 'a new birth', i. e. a new preface. W. M., when\nage will not suffer him 'to remain much longer in this troublesome\nworld', claims to have transcribed these receipts into the Queen's\nown book.\n  'The Pearle of Practice' is medical, and equals, if it does not\nexceed, any of its predecessors. For 'a special water for a consump-\ntion' there are used a peck of snails, a quart of earthworms, and\nthree gallons of strong ale. 'The soiling of a Dog that is hard and\nwhite, mixed with honey' is recommended as an outward applica-\ntion to the throat. Superfluous hairs are removed by 'Cats dung\nthat is hard and dried, beaten to powder, and tempered with strong\nVinegar'. The recipe for 'The Lady Gorings water for any Ague\nSicknesse or foulenesse in the Stomach, and to purge the Blood' is,\n'Take the Dung of a Stone-Horse that is kept in the stable when\nit is new made, mingle it well with Beer and a little Ginger, and\na good quantity of Treacle, and distill it in an ordinary Still; Give\nof this a pretty draught to drink.'\n  'A Queens Delight' is 'The Art of Preserving, Conserving, and\nCandying', but also contains some medical recipes. It tells how\n'To make a Cake the way of the Royal Princess, the Lady Elizabeth\ndaughter to King Charles the first', and how to make 'Lorenoes'\nand 'an Ipswitch Ball'. A mysterious thing is 'A Receipt to make\nDamnable Hum', unless one knows that hum was a sort of strong\nale, perhaps so named from the humming it caused in the head.\nA damnable hum must have been a drink of dangerous strength.\n  'The Compleat Cook' contains such interesting recipes as 'To\nmake a Devonshire white-pot', 'To make a Outlandish dish' (hog's\nliver seasoned with aniseed), 'The Jacobins Pottage', 'To make\na Battalia Pye', 'To make a Stumpe Pye', 'The Countesse of\nRutlands Receipt of making the rare Banbury Cake, which was so\nmuch praised at her Daughters (the Lady Chaworths) wedding',\n'To make a fat Lambe of a Pig', 'To make poor Knights'.\n\n1655 HEALTHS IMPROVEMENT :\n*or, Rules Comprizing and Discovering the Nature, Method,*\n*and Manner of Preparing all sorts of food used in this nation.*\n*Written by that ever Famous Thomas Muffett, Doctor in*\n*Physick ; Corrected and Enlarged by Christopher Bennett,*", "no_transcribable_text": false, "transcription_not_possible": false}}}
