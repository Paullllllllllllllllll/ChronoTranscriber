Dewe, and are to be sold at his\nshoppe in St. Dunstons Church-yard in Fleete-street, 1621.\n  In the course of his preface ' To all ladies and gentlewomen, and\nothers whatsoever ', the author speaks of this book as ' an Addition\nto my former practise which I did attaine unto in my travels when\nI was in France, Italy, the Low-Countries, and divers other places '.\nHe speaks of his craft as ' Art and Mistery '.\n  The book is printed within borders. The first part of it is A to\nG\u2081 in twelves, A\u2081 being blank ; there are one or two misprints,\ne.g. A instead of B. The book of cookery has a separate title-page,\nand consists of A with 8 leaves, B with 12, C with 5 ; it is a reprint\nof the edition of 1617.\n  The recipes of the ' Delightful Daily Exercise ' are much like those\nof the ' Daily Exercise '. ' To sucket candy greene Lemons, a very\ncordial thing for the Stomake ', ' To make Premellies ', ' To make\nOring chipps, a very cordial thing against the paine or wind in the\nstomacke ', ' To fry an egge as round as a ball '. There are plans\nof how sweets are to be arranged on the table.\n\n**1631**  MURRELS TWO BOOKES OF COOKERIE AND \n      CARVING.\nThe fourth time printed with new Additions.\nLondon, printed by M. F. for John Marriot, and are to be\nsold at his Shop in Saint Dunstans Church-yard in Fleet\nstreet, 1631.\n  Each book has its separate title-page, and at the end is ' A New\nBooke of Carving and Sewing ',[^1] which also has its own title-page.\nThe preface is dated July 20, 1630. In it the author disparages\nprevious cookery books, ' the most of which nevertheless have\ninstructed rather how to marre than make good Meate.'\n  The fifth edition was 1638, the sixth 1641, and the seventh 1650.\n  There are not many new recipes in the book. One pleasant one\nis ' To bake a Quince or a Warden pie, so as the fruit may be redde,\nand the crust pale and tender '. At the very end is ' An excellent\nand much approved receit, for a long Consumption '.

Creede, for William Wood, and\nare to be sold at the West end of Powles, at the signe of\nTyme, 1599.\n   This is not a cookery book, but a description of different articles\nof food on one side of the page and a ' story for table-talke ' about\neach on the other. Some of the stories could certainly not be told\nat modern dinner-tables. There is an account of the author in\nRobert Masters's *History of Corpus Christi College*. Buttes was\nelected master of the college in 1626 and vice-chancellor in 1629.\n' He being to preach before the university as vice-chancellor on\nEaster-day, April 1. 1632, was found hanging in his garters in his\nown chamber.' There is a portrait of him in the master's lodge.\nLowndes states that there is a portrait of him in Harding's *Bio-*\n*graphical Mirror*, but this seems to be a mistake.\n\n1600  NATURALL AND ARTIFICIAL DIRECTIONS\nfor health, derived from the best Philosophers, as well\nmoderne, as auncient.\nBy William Vaughan, Master of Artes, and Student in the\nCivill Law.\nLondon, printed by Richard Bradocke, 1600.\n   Part of this book is on the use of foods.

DELIGHTES FOR LADIES,\nTo adorne their Persons, Tables, Closets, and Distillatories ;\nwith Beauties, Banquets, Perfumes, & Waters.\nReade, Practice, & Censure.\nAt London, printed by Peter Short.\n   A most charming little book within borders, in some of which\nare woven the initials E R. It consists of A to H in twelves, H12\nbeing a blank leaf with borders. A rhymed epistle is signed H. Plat.\nThe book was reprinted in 1602, 1608, 1609, 1611, 1615, 1630, 1632,\n1636. Later editions, 1647, 1651, 1654, 1656, 1683, are printed\nwithout the borders. Hazlitt gives editions of 1600, 1603, 1618,\n1640.
