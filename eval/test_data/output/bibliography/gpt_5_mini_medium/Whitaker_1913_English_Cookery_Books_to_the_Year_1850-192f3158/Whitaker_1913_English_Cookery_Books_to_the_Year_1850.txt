PREFATORY NOTE

In a book called 'Notes from a Collector's Catalogue'[^1]
I gave a list of English cookery books to the year 1700,
with the name of the library in which each could be
foundand a collation of the various editions. The present
list contains the title-pages of English books on cookery
and domestic economy to the year 1850.

I may repeat what was said in the former book, that
my real interest is not in cookery but in the combination
of cookery with medicine, which is found in most of
the early books, and which, continuing through the
first quarter of the nineteenth century, was gradually
destroyed by the growth of railways.

ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

1500 THIS IS THE BOKE OF COKERY
Here beginneth a noble boke of festes royalle and Cokery
a boke for a pryncis housholde or any other estates ; and
the makynge therof as ye shall fynde more playnly within
this boke.
Emprynted without temple barre by Richard Pynson in
the yere of our lorde. M. D.

This title is given in Ames and Herbert,[^1] where it is stated that
the Dowager Duchess of Portland brought the book from Bulstrode
to London for Herbert to examine.
A book called 'A noble booke of feastes royall, and of Cookery,
for Princes housholde, or any other estate, and the making thereof',
is given by Maunsell[^2] as having been printed by John Bydell.
This is doubtless the same book, and the date would be between
1533 and 1540.

1508 HERE BEGYNNETH THE BOKE OF KER-
VYNGE.

This book is in the Cambridge Library. The colophon is 'Here
endeth the boke of servyce and kervynge and sewynge and all
maner of offyce in his kynde unto a prynce or ony other estate
and all the feestes in the yere. Emprynted by Wynkyn de Worde
at London in the Fletestrete at the sygne of the sonne. The yere
of our lorde, M,CCCCC,VIII.'

The British Museum has a copy with the colophon, 'Here endeth
the boke of servyce and kervynge and sewynge and all maner of
offyce in his kynde unto a prynce or ony other estate and all the
feestes in the yere. Emprynted by Wynkyn de Worde at London
in Flete strete at the sygne of the sonne. The yere of our lorde god,
M CCCC XIII.'

Each of the above copies is a small quarto ; A with 6 leaves,
B with 6. The book was reprinted by Abraham Veale (i.e.

between 1558 and 1586) as 'THE BOOKE OF CARVYNG', and twice by
E. Allde as 'THE BOOKE OF CARVING AND SEWING', the first edition
being without a date, the second dated 1613. These are each 12o;
the former A to C in eights, the latter two A to C4 in eights.

The book was added in 1597 to 'The second part of the Good
Hus-wifes Jewell', and in 1631 to John Murrell's 'Two bookes of
cookerie and carving'.

The book was edited for the Early English Text Society in 1868
by F. W. Furnivall.

It begins with a list of terms which are to be used by the carver,
e.g. Lyft that swanne, unlace that cony, dysplaye that crane,
dysfygure that pecocke, untache that curlew, alaye that fesande,
wynge that patryche, mynce that plover, and so on.

Later on the duties of the butler are laid down and a list of his
wines given, viz. Reed wyne, whyte wyne, clared wyne, osey, capricke,
campolet, renysche wyne, malvesey, bastarde, tyet, rommey, mus-
cadell, clarrey, raspys, vernage wyne, cut, pymente, and ypocras.

The chamberlain's duties are strange. 'The chaumberlayne must
be dylygent & clently in his offyce with his heed kembed & so to
his soverayne that he be not reckeles & se that he have a clene
sherte breche petycote and doublet. . . . And at morne whan your
soverayne wyll aryse warme his shert by the fyre.' After directions
as to dressing and washing his sovereign, the chamberlain is ordered
to 'take your leve manerly & go to the chyrche or chapell to your
soveraynes closet & laye carpentes & cuysshens & lay downe his
boke of prayers'. He is then to return and make the bed, '& bete
the federbedde & the bolster, but loke ye waste no feders.' After
this 'se the hous of hesement be swete & clene & the prevy borde
covered with a grene clothe and a cuysshyn'. Later on, after
putting the sovereign to bed, 'dryve out dogge or catte & loke
there be basyn and urynall set nere your soverayne, then take your
leve manerly that your soverayne may take his rest merily.'

The book ends with the duties of the marshal and the usher who
have to order the precedence of guests.

1539 THE TREASURE OF POORE MEN.
This little book of 44 leaves contains recipes for aqua vitae and
claret, but is mainly medical.

1539 THE CASTEL OF HELTHE,
gathered, and made by Sir Thomas Elyot knight, out of the
chief authors of Phisyke, whereby every man may knowe
the state of his owne body, the preservation of helthe, and
2,2,6,6‑Tetramethylpiperidine (TMP) – a hindered secondary amine.

'is especially good against black choller or Melancholie, it also maketh

There are recipes for a ' powder to make the belly soluble, causing
a gentle laske : meete for Noble personages', 'To make the face
fayre and the breath sweete', 'To make haire as yellow as gold',
'To make Manus Christi'.

The book next appears as a quarto with a somewhat different title :

THE TREASURIE OF HIDDEN SECRETS.
Commonlie called, The good-huswives Closet of provision,
for the health of her Houshold.
Gathered out of sundry experiments, lately practised by men
of great knowledge : And now newly enlarged, with divers
necessary Phisicke helpes, and knowledge of the names

At London, printed by J R for Edward White, and are
to be sold at his shop at the little North doore of Paules,

It is a thin quarto, A to I in fours. It was reprinted twice in
1627 and again in 1633, 1637, and 1653. Professor Ferguson gives
an edition of 1656.

Imprinted at London, in Fleete streete, by William How,
for Abraham Veale, 1574.

This is not a cookery book, but merely contains advice as to the
use of food. Gratarolus was an Italian who was compelled to leave
his country on account of his having embraced the Calvinist faith.

and I. H., 1582.

Fioravante died at Bologna in 1588. The translator of the book
was John Hester, of whom there is an account in the D. N. B. The
cookery receipts are in Book III. Curious pieces of information are
given, e.g. 'Take a Capon and pull awaie all his feathers from his
breaste, and beate hym with Nettles, and he will call in the young
Chickens, and governe them like the Henne.'

1583  *THE SCHOOLEMASTER*

ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

in 1620 under the title of 'A Booke of Cookerie'. The book tells
one how 'To make nuggets', 'To make a mortis', 'To make
a Blewmanger'. A cure for obesity is likely to do quite as much
good as the modern quack remedies. 'To make one slender. Take
Fennell, and seeth it in Water, a very good quantity, and wringing
out the juyce thereof when it is sodde, drink it first and last, and it
shall swage either man or woman.'

North doore of Paules Church, at the signe of the Gunne.

Another edition of 1597 has added to it 'The Booke of Carving'.
Maunsell gives an edition of 1590, and Hazlitt one of 1606. The
book is similar to the first part and has 72 pages. The head-line
is 'A Booke of Cookerie'. In the 1597 edition, 'The Booke of Carving
and Sewing' has a separate title-page and is unpaged.

There are recipes 'To make Pursses or Cremitaries',—this begins
'Take a little Mary'—'To make Jombrils', 'To make a Colluce',

lated, is not a cookery book, but gives advice as to the use of foods.

Non nobis solum nati sumus, sed ortus nostri sibi vendicant,
Printed in London by Tho. Creede, for William Wood, and
are to be sold at the West end of Powles, at the signe of
Tyme, 1599.

This is not a cookery book, but a description of different articles
of food on one side of the page and a 'story for table-talke' about
each on the other. Some of the stories could certainly not be told
at modern dinner-tables. There is an account of the author in
Robert Masters's History of Corpus Christi College. Buttes was
elected master of the college in 1626 and vice-chancellor in 1629.
'He being to preach before the university as vice-chancellor on
Easter-day, April 1. 1632, was found hanging in his garters in his
own chamber.' There is a portrait of him in the master's lodge.
Lowndes states that there is a portrait of him in Harding's Bio-
graphical Mirror, but this seems to be a mistake.

1600  NATURALL AND ARTIFICIALL DIRECTIONS
for health, derived from the best Philosophers, as well
moderne, as auncient.
By William Vaughan, Master of Artes, and Student in the
Civill Law.
London, printed by Richard Bradocke, 1600.

Part of this book is on the use of foods. The author, who lived
from 1577 to 1641, helped to colonize Newfoundland. 1602 (2),
1607 (3), 1617 (5), 1626 (6), 1633 (7).

To adorne their Persons, Tables, Closets, and Distillatories;

Reade, Practice, & Censure.

A most charming little book within borders, in some of which
are woven the initials E R. It consists of A to H in twelves, H12
being a blank leaf with borders. A rhymed epistle is signed H. Plat.
The book was reprinted in 1602, 1608, 1609, 1611, 1615, 1630, 1632,
1636. Later editions, 1647, 1651, 1654, 1656, 1683, are printed
without the borders. Hazlitt gives editions of 1600, 1603, 1618,
1640. Hugh Plat, the son of a London brewer, was born in 1552,
and knighted in 1605 as a reward for his literary efforts.

ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

The recipes seem as charming as the book itself.(' The most
kindly waie to preserve plums', 'To make a paste to keepe you
moist, if you list not to drincke oft, which Ladies use to carry with
them when they ride abroad', 'To candie Orange pilles', 'To make
a cullis as white as snowe, and in the nature of gellie', 'Usquebash
or Irish Aqua vitae', 'a Scottish handwater'.

body of Man in continuall Health.
London : Printed for John Helme, and John Busby Junior,
and are to be solde at the little shoppe, next Clifford's Inne
gate, in Fleet-streete. 1607.

This is the earliest translation of the famous Latin poem said to
have been written by the physicians of Salerno for the preservation
of the health of Robert, eldest son of William the Conqueror. The
commentary, written by Arnaldus de Villa Nova, who died about
1313, was translated as early as 1528 by T. Paynell. The poem is
concerning the use of foods. Among other editions there is one of
1634 'whereunto is annexed a necessary Discourse of all sorts of
Fish in use among us, with their effects, appertayning to the health
of Man'.

1608  A CLOSET FOR LADIES AND GENTLEWOMEN,

Diseases.

great North dore of Pauls, 1608.

12o; A to M in eights; pages 1-190. A little book within borders,
much resembling 'Delightes for Ladies' by Plat, to whom the book
is attributed in the Douce catalogue, but it looks more like a rival
work.

The book was reprinted in 1611, and again in 1630, 1632, and
1636 with different borders. An edition of 1647 has a portrait of
a lady as frontispiece, but no borders. Later editions of 1651, 1654,

are to be sould. Farewell.' The recipes begin with 'To make
Paste of Regia against a Consumption', but most of the others
look delightful. 'To make rough red marmalade of Quinces, com-

'To make red Marmalade of Pippins, orient and cleare', 'To make
Dia Setonia of Quinces, a cordiall for the stomack', 'To make
Conserve of Cowslips, good against Melancholy', 'To make Quid-
doniock', 'To make an excellent Bread called Ginetoes', 'To make
Aqua-Coelestis', 'To make Letters, Knots, or any other Jumball

such strange things as 'Pennet', 'Callishones', 'Muscachones',
'Muscadinoes, commonly called kissing-Comfits', 'Canalones',
'Rushilians', 'Gentilissoes', and 'Novellissoes'.

'To make Pancakes so crispe that you may set them upright',
'A sallet of rose-buds and clove gilly-flowers', 'A fierced pudding',

1634.

A book on the uses of foods. The first edition of the original
was 1613. Another translation of the book, by 'Timothy Smith,
Apothecary', was published in 1743.
At the beginning of the 1634 edition is 'A Dialogue between
a Glutton and Echo', which begins :

My belly I do deifie.
Fie.
Who curbs his appetite 's a fool.
Ah fool.
When the warparty came through the Gilrath Pass, they came like smoke—coiling, dark, a living shadow that swallowed the
road and spat out banners. Lysandra of the Crow-Companions had been waiting for smoke for a long time. She watched it
from her watch-shelf, a slab of wind-scraped stone above the gorge, and she smiled without pleasure. War makes the best
captives.

They did not so much break as dry into pieces. Two of the packs ran at the river—young wolves who did not know the
river's moods—and the rest found themselves stepping into a net not of rope but of song. Lysandra's raiders had learned
the old art of folding sound into traps: a reed flute hummed low in the reeds, counterbeats laid through the underbrush,
a chorus of high, thin notes that tugged at helmets and made men separate from each other. When the drums fell silent,
when the colors blurred into one, her girls moved—swift hands, soft boots—and by dusk thirty-four soldiers lay on their
backs in the mud, bound and breathing.

Their leader lay on a cot in the skylit hold of the Raven's Spire, his hands bound in iron cords that bore the runes of
cutting. Lysandra sat on a barrel across from him, a ledger open in her lap. It was not a beautiful book—trade never
was—but it held the orders and rulings of every ransom she'd ever set: names and prices, ink stippled with old blood and
candle wax. She wrote in a steady hand. Ransom was business. Business did not look at faces.

He was not what she expected.

She had expected a hulking captain, the kind who wore last night's conquest like armor. The man across from her was too
small for his armor and had a jaw that might have been carved by a tired knife. His hair was the color of smoldering
peat and his eyes were the strange, flat green of a winter field. He looked at her the way a man looks at someone he is
trying to remember from a dream: careful, curious, inclined to tenderness before suspicion.

"You will write it down, then?" he asked, his voice low, threadbare with many nights and the smell of rain.

She did not look up. "Three thousand aurics for the captain's freedom," she said. "Five hundred apiece for lieutenants.
Two hundred for the boys and girls. Or a lesser payment and we keep hands. Terms in the ledger are final. You will sign
with your name, the name of your lord, or the token exchanged shall be forfeit. That is custom. It is law. It is safe."
She tapped a runed stamp against the page and the ink beneath flared like blood—binding.

He watched that like a man who had seen magic all his life and was not pleased by it. "Safe for you, perhaps. My lord
will not pay three thousand for a man who does not come back in the colors he left in. He will prefer to buy his banners
back instead. He will prefer blood to coin sometimes." A humor, thin as wire, twisted the corner of his mouth. "Tell
me—Captain Lysandra—how many times have you had to hold a man while his neighbors sold him?"

The ledger made a dry sound as her pen moved across the page. "Often enough that it does not keep me awake."

He smiled then, surprisingly. It did not charm her the way it might have in another life. It pricked her, a small pinch,
a reminder that men still had faces under their armor. "You should sleep sometimes. It is good for the constables. It
might soothe the ledger, too."

She looked at him properly then. He had the murk of river-water in his eyes, and palms callused as if they had once been
used to steering oars instead of spears. On the inside of his wrist, a faint map of a burn, scalloped like a coastline.
A face with scars is a face with orders written on it. She set the pen down.

"Your men are worth more to me alive," she said. "Alive, they eat and they pay. Dead, they are ash on the wind. Either
way, their gold will be my wages. I could carve them down and leave nothing for the markets and call it mercy—" She
shrugged. "But I am not a butcher by trade. I ask for coin, not screams."

He laughed, soft and surprised. "You have a tidy way of speaking about the cries of mothers. Is that what keeps you
awake? The ledger? Or the look on the face of a man you cannot return to his home?"

She felt, absurdly, as if he had stepped from the page of every letter she'd once written to someone long dead. She
thought of a child's face she kept folded under the ledger's back cover, a note in a hand that she no longer trusted.
She shut the ledger with a force more savage than she meant.

"We trade in survival," she said coldly. "You are not the first to go home with your men. I will send word. If your lord
sends coin, you will go. If not—"

"If not you will sell us to the mines. Yes, I know the path. It is your trade and it is clean. But there is another way,
Captain. I can bargain for my men without a purse. I know the tongues of markets. I have friends—people in the city who
will trade favors for the sight of their rivals in chains. Let me speak to them. Give me a day. If I return no heavier
with coin, take us, do what you must. But give me the chance." He touched his wrist where the runes' echo throbbed
faintly beneath the skin. It was a small, hopeful gesture. He looked at her and it felt for a second as if he could see
the ledger, the child's face, perhaps even the small soreness at the base of her skull where responsibility sat like a
stone.

Lysandra surprised herself by surprising him. "You ask me to trust you with my operations? You ask the raider to spend
coin and time on your honor?" Her laugh was narrow. "A brave request."

"Not coin. Time. Word. A man's word is a coin in some places, Captain." He smiled then, without irony: a patient,
earnest grin that suggested he'd once coaxed a stubborn horse into a stall. "I will not run. Let me see my men. Let me
speak to them and promise them that I will not barter their hands for a purse. Watch me try and break the silence with
reason. I am a poor man, but I am a captain. I ask the courtesy of a captain's hour. If I make a mess, you take them
afterward. If I do not—" He shrugged. "If I do not, you will have been disappointed by a man, not fooled by him. There
is honor in that."

There was an odd, old-fashioned steadiness to him that made Lysandra imagine a man who had once built small, practical
things and set them imperfectly against the world. She found herself nodding before she had decided to. The ledger, like
a jealous god, seemed to breathe out between them.

"You have the hour," she said. "One hour at dusk. Speak to your men. Make your bargains. None of this—no cunning with
the runes. The stamp stays here. No deals with my girls, either. We are not merchants of flesh, Ser. Trade in coin or
not at all."

He inclined his head, amusement and gratitude mingling. "Thank you. Then—if I succeed—what becomes of you?"

The question made her think of things she had not let herself think of in a long time: the slow erosion of something
human inside a ledger's margins, the night birds that nested in the rafters of her house, the way warmth sometimes clung
to a shoulder like a visiting ghost. She could have said 'nothing', because in practice ransoming a warparty seldom
changed a captain's life. She could have said 'you will be boiled in oil', because that would hold her name like a
blade. Instead she said, without understanding how or why, "You will go home. You will remember this. You will keep a
piece of what you owe me."

His face shifted—first with suspicion, then with a strange, luminous hope. He reached up with the slimmest of motions
and brushed at the hair across his jaw where a nick almost, almost creased the skin. The action was nothing, and it felt
like a confession.

When the hour came, she led him to the enclosure where his men slept awkwardly as children forced into neat beds. He
spoke to them with a voice that was not entirely the measured cadence of a commander but the quick, personal sound of a
brother. He asked after wounds as if he feared them like small birds; he promised food and told jokes until rough mouths
opened in half-smiles. He argued with a lieutenant over whether the boy in the second row should be put in the care of
the synagogue or sent back to his sister; his choice unsettled her. He moved among them like a hand among warm
coals—attentive and careful.

Lysandra watched for the hour and then for ten extra minutes because the ledger felt stupid and thin beside the movement
of a man like that. He did not plead to her or flatter her; he did not grovel. He worked. He made a map out of his
friendships and offered pieces of himself like bread. When at last he walked back toward the hold, he carried a small
bundle wrapped in a faded blue cloth. It might have been coin. It might have been a scrap of paper. She did not ask.

He stopped at the foot of her barrel and met her eyes. There was rain in the world beyond the spire, slate and slow. The
runes on the iron cords between them flared, as if expecting the order that would lift them; as if the ledger wanted a
name to eat. The man fanned his fingers, and for an instant she looked at the hollow where his wrist burned and saw a
line through it like a seam. He spoke softly.

"I failed to keep one of my boys from the city gaol once," he said. "I made a bargain to bring him back and broke it. I
thought then that nothing could take me anymore. I was wrong. Regret is a clever animal; it finds its way into every
gold purse I put down. If you take coin from me and give me my men, I will be in your debt. If you let me go because of
what I bought with words, I will be twice in your debt. Both debts are dangerous. I—" He stopped, and there was the
tiniest, barest of smiles. "—I would prefer the second."

The words touched something under her ribs she had kept bone-dead for years. She had always taken debts from others and
kept them like coins to shove in her boot. She had never been the one to hold a debt in her hand like a warm thing and
imagine giving it away. For a breath she saw a future that did not have the ledger at its center: mornings with fewer
compromises, nights where someone else closed the door against the cold.

That was ridiculous, she told herself. She was absurd. She had work to do. Ransom was profit and the world did not
soften for the desperate. But sense, like wind, bends the reed. Something inside her cracked open small and kindly. She
reached out, impulsive and against all the rules she had kept against the years, and touched the back of his hand.

His skin was warm, the texture of a man who had lived. He caught her fingers without surprise and held them there as if
words could be tied that way.

"Then we are both fools," she said, and the thing she said felt like an answer, not a vow. "One hour's coin, one hour's
chance. If you bring me nothing, I will finish the ledger. If you bring me honor, I will explain to my girls that you
have paid me in a different coin."

He bowed, not like a servant but like a man who owned small graces. "Then let's be fools together, Captain. For the
hour's sake."

Outside, the rain began. In the tower, bound men slept and breathed and dreamed of home. On the ledger, the ink dried
into patterns, and for the first time in a long time they looked like more than rules. Lysandra closed the book with
fingers that trembled a fraction and felt, for the length of a heartbeat, like someone who had been sold once and bought
back again.

It was, in the business she had chosen, a terrible way to start anything. It was exactly the beginning of everything.

Published by La Fountaine, an Expert Operator.
London, printed Anno Dom. 1649.

This is a quarto of 4 leaves with a few cookery recipes. It is
reprinted in a book of the same date by Salvator Winter1 of Naples
and Francisco Dickinson, and ascribed to Dickinson. All three were
quacks who at the end of their books advertised their residence
and their ability to 'pull out all manner of Hollow Teeth, stumps
or roots, with great dexterity and ease, without almost any paine'.

These two books, by the same author (W. Jar.), seem to have
been issued together, though the pagination is distinct and occa-

ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS  <page_number>23</page_number>

sionally one book is seen without the other. The lettering of the
sheets is also distinct in the first edition and in one imprint of
the second edition, but in other editions it is continuous. The book
is a small octavo in size; A with 4 leaves, B to F8 in twelves,
followed by A with 4 leaves, B to E4 in twelves. The copy in the
British Museum looks of much later date than subsequent editions,
which are of a small duodecimo size, but there was a Roger Norton
printer from 1639 to 1662, so that it is difficult to regard it as
a reprint. The second edition was 1653, of which there are two
imprints. Other editions are 1658 (10), 1659 (11), 1661, 1663 (14),
1667 (15), 1682 (18), 1687 (19), 1708. Professor Ferguson gives the
4th edition as 1654, and the 12th as 2659 (sic). He also notes an
edition of 1656.

There is a portrait of the Countess of Kent as frontispiece to all
the editions except the first, and it may be mentioned that the
book is catalogued under her name, Elizabeth Grey, in the British
Museum. She was second daughter of Gilbert Talbot, Earl of
Shrewsbury, and wife of Henry de Grey, Earl of Kent. She died
at Whitefriars on December 7, 1751.[^1]

The first book is purely medical, and recommends the usual filthy
remedies, e. g. the dung of a peacock for convulsions and powdered
earthworms for jaundice. It gives 'A cordiall for the Sea. Take one
ounce of Sirupe of Clove-gilliflowers, one drachm of Confectio Alchermes,
one ounce and a half of Borrage water, and the like of Mint-water,
one ounce of Mr. Mountfords water, and as much of Cinnamon-water,
temper all these together in a Cordial, and take a spoonful at a time
when you are at sea'. The second book is the cookery part, and
tells how to make a slipcoat Cheese, Anglelets, fine Diet-bread,
Essings, Ponado, Bonny Clutter, Lady of Arundels Manchett, &c.

1653 THE FRENCH COOK.

London, printed for Charles Adams, and are to be sold at
his Shop, at the Sign of the Talbot neere St. Dunstans
Church in Fleetstreet, 1653.

This is a translation of *Le Cuisinier françois*, which ran through
many editions in the original. There is a frontispiece representing
a cook in his kitchen. The second edition (1654) also contains it,
but it is omitted in the third[^1] (1673), which is of larger size than
the previous editions. This is the first cookery book which has
any order and arrangement in its contents.

1653  A BOOK OF FRUITS AND FLOWERS.

Medicine. As also to Preserve, Conserve, Candy, and in

[^1]: There is a warning in this edition against 'a Counterfeit Piece in
imitation thereof, by the Title of The English and French Cook; it being only
patched up by mangling and spoiling the approved Receipts of this Book'.
I don't recognize this as coming from any actual cartoon or anime. That GIF is a meme edit — the audio/line “If anything
happens to my otter…” is a joke overlay, not a genuine subtitle from a real show. In other words, it's a fan edit/meme,
not a scene from a particular cartoon.

London, printed by Tho. Newcomb for Samuel Thomson, at
the sign of the White Horse in Pauls Churchyard, 1655.

This is a very interesting book on the choice and preparation of
food by Thomas Muffett, who was born in 1553 and died in 1604.
He became M.P. for Wilton in 1597. The book bears the im-
primatur of the President and Censors of the College of Physicians.
It was reprinted in 1746.

1656 *THE PERFECT COOK.*
Being the most exact directions for the making all kind of
Pastes, with the perfect way teaching how to Raise, Season,

most refined way of French and English.
The like never extant ;
With fifty-five ways of dressing of Eggs.
By Mounsieur Marnette.
Printed at London for Nath. Brooks at the Angel in Cornhil,
1656.

There is a frontispiece of two men and a woman in a kitchen,
engraved by Ro. Vaughan. A later edition of 1686 has no frontis-
piece, and probably this edition did not have one.

From the preface we see that the author was born in London of
foreign parents, and was 'turned young into the wild and Military
World, to become a Son of Mars'. After a time he returned to
London and resigned himself 'to Minerva's milder tuition and pro-
tection'. He apologizes for presenting a book on pastry 'to this
Nation, where every Matron and young Damsel are so well vers'd
ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS  <page_number>29</page_number>

in the Pastry Art, as that they may out-vie the best Forreign Pastry
Cooks in all the World besides'.

The book seems to be the one mentioned in London's Catalogue
of the most vendible books (1657) as 'The French and English
cooke, for exact making all sorts of pasts, pasties, Florentines, &c.
ordering of French, Spanish, and Italian kickshawes, dressing, flesh,
fowle, and fish; with admirable sawces 12o'.

The first part of the book is a translation of *Le Pastissier françois*,
which was published in 1653. An Amsterdam edition of 1655 has
the same frontispiece as the English edition and the original of its
preface. There are recipes for making Chossons, Flawns, Rattoones,
Darioles, Poupelains, Tourrons, buttered Wiggs, Ganby Bisket, and
the good Wives Tart or a Tart for a friend in a corner, all of which
seem very good. The 55 ways of dressing eggs include 'an Omelet
according to the newest mode, Oxford Gates, or the Covent Garden
guise'.

Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne was born at Mayerne, near
Geneva, in 1573. He came to London in 1606, and was appointed
physician first to the queen and then to the king. He died at
Chelsea in 1655. Most, if not all, of the recipes are copied from
earlier books. The compiler, who doubtless invented the fiction of
a Mayerne manuscript, in a learned preface quotes Plato and Plautus.

Other editions are 1665 (2), 1671 (3), of which there are two
imprints, 1678 (4), 1685 (5).
As frontispiece there is a portrait with 'Aætis Suæ 71, 1660'
in background, and beneath are the lines:

For Nathaniell Brooke, att the Angell in Cornehill.
According to Granger (Biog. Hist. iv. 68) the portrait is by Gaywood.
Southey quotes the title-page in Omniana, ii. 70.

There are two poems at the beginning in May's honour, and a story
of his life which mentions that he was the son of a cook and was
trained in France. This training accounts for his giving nine recipes
for preparing snails and one for baking frogs. In the preface May
says that 'God and my own Conscience would not permit me to
bury these my Experiences in the Grave', and that 'The Queens
Closet Opened' was the only book comparable to his own.

There is another edition of 1662, which has a frontispiece repre-
senting a lady and her cook in a kitchen.

This is the first book by this authoress, who, according to the
D. N. B., was married at the age of 24 to one Woolley, who had
been master of the free school at Newport, and was married in 1666
to a Francis Challinor, of St. Margaret's, Westminster. Granger
(Biog. Hist. v. 308) expresses doubt as to the real authorship of
the books ascribed to her. In the preface she speaks of 'this little
Book, which though but little, containeth more than all the books
that ever I saw Printed in this Nature, they being rather Con-
founders than Instructors'.

And now made Publick for General Satisfaction.
London, printed by Tho. Milbourn, for Randal Taylor in
St. Martins Le Grand, 1664.

A manuscript note in the B. M. copy says there should be a print
as frontispiece. The paging and the lettering of the sheets are both
irregular.

A long and learned introduction, quoting Epictetus and Plato,
is an attack on the family of Cromwell, but its object must have
been to act as an advertisement of the book, which is nothing but
an ordinary cookery book. The recipes are introduced by this
preface, 'Here followes the most usual Meat and Diet observed at
her Table, most of them ordinary and vulgar, except some few
Rarities, but such as arrided her Palate and Expense, of which it
will be no unpleasing Labour to the Reader, to peruse the Cookery,
and manner of Dressing, as also her Preserves, &c.' Two recipes
have a definite personal reference attached, 'How to make Scotch
Collops of Veal (this was almost her constant Dish)', 'How to make
Marrow Puddings (which she usually had to her Breakfast)'.
