: PREFATORY NOTE
: In a book called ‘ Notes from a Collector’s Catalogue’!
I gave a list of English cookery books to the year 1700,
: with the name of the library in which each could be
f° found and a collation of the various editions. The present
list contains the title-pages of English books on cookery
| and domestic economy to the year 1850.
a I may repeat what was said in the former book, that
| my real interest is not in cookery but in the combination
4 of cookery with medicine, which is found in most of
oo the early books, and which, continuing through the
first quarter of the nineteenth century, was gradually
destroyed by the growth of railways.

yoo: THIS IS THE BOKE OF COKERY
Here beginneth a noble boke of festes royalle and Cokery
a boke for a pryncis housholde or any other estates ; and

! the makynge therof as ye shall fynde more playnly within .
this boke.

Emprynted without temple barre by Richard Pynson in
the yere of our lorde. MD.

This title is given in Ames and Herbert,’ where it is stated that
the Dowager Duchess of Portland brought the book from Bulstrode
to London for Herbert to examine.

A book called ‘A noble booke of feastes royall, and of Cookerie,

for Princes housholde, or any other estate, and the making thereof ’,
is given by Maunsell? as having been printed by John Byddell.

This is doubtless the same book, and the date would be between
1533 and 1540.

~ 7508 HERE BEGYNNETH THE BOKE OF KER-

VYNGE.

This book is in the Cambridge Library. The colophon is ‘ Here
endeth the boke of servyce and kervynge and sewynge and all
maner of offyce in his kynde unto a prynce or ony other estate
and all the feestes in the yere. Emprynted by Wynkyn de Worde
at London in the Fletestrete at the sygne of the sonne. The yere

of our lorde, M,CCCCC, VIII,’

The British Museum has a copy with the colophon, ‘ Here endeth
the boke of servyce and kervynge and sewynge and all maner of
offyce in his kynde unto a prynce or ony other estate and all the
feestes in the yere. [Emprynted by Wynkyn de Worde at London
in Flete strete at the sygne of the sonne. The yere of our lorde god,
M CCCCC XITI.’

Each of the above copies is a small quarto; A with 6 leaves, —
B with 6. The book was reprinted by Abraham Veale (i.e.

* The first part of the Catalogue of English printed Bookes (1595).

2 ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

between 1558 and 15386) as ‘THE BOOKE OF CARVYNG * and twice by
E. Allde as ‘THE BOOKE OF CARVING AND SEWING’, the first edition
being without a date, the second dated 1613. These are each 12°;
the former A to C in eights, the latter two A to C, in eights.

The book was added in 1597 to ‘ The second part of the Good
Hus-wifes Jewell’, and in 1631 to John Murrell’s ‘Two bookes of
cookerie and carving ’.

The book was edited for the Early English Text Society in 1868
by F. W. Furnivall.

It begins with a list of terms which are to be used by the carver,
e.g. Lyft that swanne, unlace that cony, dysplaye that crane,
dysfygure that pecocke, untache that curlew, alaye that fesande,
wynge that patryche, mynce that plover, and so on.

) Later on the duties of the butler are laid down and a list of his
wines given, viz. Reed wyne, whyte wyne, clared wyne, osey, capricke,
campolet, renysche wyne, malvesey, bastarde, tyet, romney, mus-
cadell, clarrey, raspys, vernage wyne, cut, pymente, and ypocras.

The chamberlain’s duties are strange. ‘ The chaumberlayne must
be dylygent & clenly in his offyce with his heed kembed & so to
his soverayne that he be not reckeles & se that he have a clene
sherte breche petycote and doublet. ... And at morne whan your ;
soverayne wyll aryse warme his shert by the fyre.’ After directions
as to dressing and washing his sovereign, the chamberlain is ordered
to ‘take your leve manerly & go to the chyrche or chapell to your
soveraynes closet & laye carpentes & cuysshens & lay downe his
boke of prayers’. He is then to return and make the bed, ‘ & bete
the federbedde & the bolster, but loke ye waste no feders.’ After
this ‘se the hous of hesement be swete & clene & the prevy borde
covered with a grene clothe and a cuysshyn’. Later on, after

, putting the sovereign to bed, ‘dryve out dogge or catte & loke
there be basyn and urynall set nere your soverayne, then take your
leve manerly that your sovcrayne may take his rest meryly.’

The book ends with the duties of the marshal and the usher who
have to order the precedence of guests.

1539 THE TREASURE OF POORE MEN.

This little book of 44 leaves contains recipes for aqua vitae and

claret, but is mainly medical. :

1539 THE CASTEL OF HELTHE,

gathered, and made by Sir Thomas Elyot knight, out of the
chief authors of Phisyke, whereby every man may knowe
the state of his owne body, the preservation of helthe, and

g delyghteth in Cokerye.
- The earliest known edition, which bears no date, is in the library
' of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. It was printed by ‘ John
Kynge and Thomas Marche’. It is a small book of 16 leaves ;
A to Bin eights, B, blank. A reprint has recently been edited by
Miss C. F. Frere.
te Ames and Herbert (ili. 256) give an edition of 1545, printed with
F Richard Lant, and Hazlitt gives one of 1546, printed. by Richard
, Lant and Richard Bankes.
- The British Museum has editions of 1575 (printed by William
Me How for Abraham Veale) and of 1376 (printed for Antony Kytson).
- Maunsell gives ‘A LITTLE OLDE 800KE OF COOKERIE’, printed by
Antony Kytson, and Ames and Herbert (iii. 571) give ‘aA NEWE
BOKE OF COKERY’, printed by Thomas Raynald. Perhaps these are
editions of the same book, but the latter would be an early edition
between 1540 and 1550.
Some of the recipes are strange—A tart of Bourage Flowers,
A pye of aloes (not so alarming as it seems from the title), A tart
. of Marygoldes, Primroses, or Cowslips, A tart of Spinage, To make

into English, by Wyllyam Warde.

Inglande, dwellinge in Poules Churchyarde. Anno 1558.

Menss. Novemb.

This contains recipes for making ipocras, confitures, &c.

1562 Here foloweth A COMPEDYOUS REGYMENT OR
A DYETARY OF HELTH, made in Mofitpylior :
compiled by Andrewe Boorde, of Physicke Doctor.

The earliest edition has no date, the next is dated 1562. This
book, like Elyot’s Castle of Health, is not a cookery book, but
gives advice as to the use of food. The author was a man of most .
varied experiences, not always reputable though he had once been
a bishop.

1573 THE TREASURIE OF COMMODIOUS CON-
CEITES, AND HIDDEN SECRETS. |

Commonly called The Good Huswives Closet of provision

for the health of her houshold.

Meete and necessarie for the profitable use of all estates,

gathered out of sundry Experiments lately practised by men

of great knowledge.

The earliest known copy has lost its title-page, but the colophon
is, ‘These Bookes are to be sould at the West ende of Paules Church:
By Richard Jones, the Printer hereof, 1573.’ It is a small 12° book.

The British Museum has an edition of 1584, ‘the fourth tyme
corrected and inlayed, with divers necessary and new editions,’ and
one of 1586. The Bodleian has an edition of 1591, and Hazlitt
mentions editions of 1580, 1586, 1594, and 1596.

The book is by John Partridge, of whose history nothing seems
known, and it cost four pence. It is dedicated to ‘Master Richard
Wistow, one of the Assistants of the Companie of the Barbers and
Surgeons ’,

One of the most striking features of the book is the number of
conserves it gives and their virtues. Thus the conserve of straw-
berries is ‘ good against a hote liver, burning of the stomacke, and
specially in the fervent heat of an ague’, the conserve of buglosse
flowers ‘ comforteth the hote heart ’, the conserve of borage flowers

y It is a thin quarto, A to I in fours. It was reprinted twice in
1627 and again in 1633, 1637, and 1653. Professor Ferguson gives
an edition of 1656.

Imprinted at London, in Fleete streete, by William How,
for Abraham Veale, 1574.
This is not a cookery book, but merely contains advice as to the
use of food. Gratarolus was an Italian who was compelled to leave
: his country on account of his having embraced the Calvinist faith.

and I. H., 1582.
Fioravante died at Bologna in 1588. The translator of the book

was John Hester, of whom there is an account in the D.N.B. The

cookery receipts are in Book III. Curious pieces of information are

given, e.g. ‘Take a Capon and pull awaie all his feathers from his

breaste, and beate hym with Nettles, and he will call in the young

Chickens, and governe them like the Henne.’

1583. THE SCHOOLEMASTER

: This book was written by Thomas Twyne, a doctor of Lewes, or
s Thomas Turswell, a Canon of St. Paul’s. The D.N.B. suggests
that the ‘honest Jestes ’ were hardly such as could be dedicated
| by a canon to his dean. The D.N.B. mentions an edition of 1576.

undated edition, and Hazlitt one of 1610, The book was reprinted

‘
in 1620 under the title of ‘A Booke of Cookerie’. The book -tells
one how ‘To make muggets’, ‘To make a mortis’, ‘To make
a Blewmanger’. Acure for obesity is likely to do quite as much
good as the modern quack remedies. ‘To make one slender. Take
Fennell, and seeth it in Water, a very good quantity, and wringing
out the juyce thereof when it is sodde, drink it first and last, and it
shall swage either man or woman.’

book is similar to the first part and has 72 pages. The head-line
is ‘A Booke of Cookerie’. Inthe 1597 edition, ‘The Booke of Carving
and Sewing ’ has a separate title-page and is unpaged.

There were editions of 1631 and 1639; the former is in the

In a preface signed M.R. the book is said to have been written
‘at the earnest request and sute of a Gentlewoman in the Country
ES for her private use, which by these singular practices hath obtained
4 such fame, that her name shall bee remembered for ever to the
Posterity ’. In spite of the preface it is difficult to believe that
& a gentlewoman could have treated or even described so plainly some
a of the diseases mentioned. The book has no arrangement of sub-
. jects. Thus five consecutive recipes are, ‘To keepe Venison from
rotting ’, ‘ To keepe Peares ’, ‘ To kill Lice ’, ‘ Against drunkennesse’,
‘To make Linnen Cloth, or Yarne white’. A recipe for ‘ Diatrion
Piperion ’, made of pepper, time, ginger, aniseeds, &c., moves the
author or authoress to poetry.

This is not a cookery book, but a description of different articles
of food on one side of the page and a ‘story for table-talke ’ about
& each on the other. Some of the stories could certainly not be told
at modern dinner-tables. There is an account of the author in
Robert Masters’s History of Corpus Christi College. Buttes was
: elected master of the college in 1626 and vice-chancellor in 1629,
‘He being to preach before the university as vice-chancellor on
Easter-day, April I. 1632, was found hanging in his garters in his
own chamber.’ There is a portrait of him in the master’s lodge.
Lowndes states that there is a portrait of him in Harding’s Bio-

The recipes seem as charming as the book itself... ‘The most
kindly waie to preserve plums’, ‘To make a paste to keepe you
moist, if you list not to drinke oft, which Ladies use to carry with
them when they ride abroad ’, ‘ To candie Orange pilles ’, ‘ To make
a cullis as white as snowe, and in-the nature of gellie ’, ‘ Usquebash

1607 THE ENGLISHMAN’S DOCTER, OR THE
SCHOOLE OF SALERNE,

or, Physicall observations for the perfect Preserving of the

body of Man in continuall Health.

London: Printed for John Helme, and John Busby Junior,

and are to be solde at the little shoppe, next Clifford’s Inne

gate, in Fleet-streete. 1607.

This is the earliest translation of the famous Latin poem said to
have been written by the physicians of Salerno for the preservation
of the health of Robert, eldest son of William the Conqueror. The
commentary, written by Arnaldus de Villa Nova, who died about
1313, was translated as early as 1528 by T. Paynell. The poem is
concerning the use of foods. Among other editions there is one of
1634 ‘whereunto is annexed a necessary Discourse of all sorts of
Fish in use among us, with their effects, appertayning to the health
of Man’. .
1608 A CLOSET FOR LADIES AND GENTLEWOMEN,
or, The Art of preserving, Conserving, and Candying.

and all kind of banqueting stuffes.

Also divers soveraigne Medicines and Salves, for sundry
Diseases.

At London, printed for Arthur Johnson, dwelling neere the
great North dore of Pauls, 1608.

12°; Ato Mineights ; pages 1-190. A little book within borders,
much resembling ‘ Delightes for Ladies ’ by Plat, to whom the book
is attributed in the Douce catalogue, but it looks more like a rival
work.

The book was reprinted in 1611, and again in 1630, 1632, and

- 1636 with different borders. An edition of 1647 has a portrait of
a lady as frontispiece, but no borders. Later editions of 1651, 1654,
ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS 15
and 1656 have a table of contents, but no portrait and no borders.

Hazlitt gives an edition of 1635. This book contains many tempting

recipes. “To make a Walnut, that when you cracke it, you shall
7 find Biskets, and Carrawayes in it, or a prettie Posey written.’
g ‘To make an excellent Marmelate which was given Queene Mary
for a New-yeares gift.’ ‘To make another sort of Marmelate very
- comfortable and restorative for any Lord or Lady whatsoever.’
c The following seems to be the remedy of the day for appendicitis.

8 The first edition of this book was entered in the Stationers’

Register of May 29, 1609, but no copy is known. The book, which
is on the uses of foods and on many other topics, is famous for
being the first to contain a quotation from Hamlet. The third
edition was printed for Nicholas Vavasour in 1633. ‘The original,

Mensa Philosophica, of which the first known edition is 1475, has

been ascribed both to Sir Michael Scott and to Theobald Anguilbert,

an Irish physician. According to a note in one of Sotheby’s cata-
if logues W. B. was probably the same person who published the

F ‘Court of Good Counsel’ in 1607, ‘A Help to Discourse’ in 1619,
and a paraphrase of the tenth satire of Juvenal in 1617. Part of

‘A Help to Discourse ’ is from ‘ The Philosophers Banquet ’.

_ This is the second book of ‘ Countrey Contentments ’, by Gervase
Markham, who was born about 1568 and died in 1637. He has
been called ‘the earliest English hackney writer’. Other editions
are 1623, 1631 (4), 1637 (5), 1648, 1649, 1656 (6), 1660 (7), 1664,
1668 (8), 1675, 1683 (9). An edition of 1653 was reprinted by
Constance, Countess De La Warr, in 1907.

The cookery recipes seem more modern than those of preceding
books, although many of the dishes are obsolete, e.g. leach and
jumbal. The medical recipes, however, are appalling, animal dung
and other filth being frequent ingredients.

The first book is purely medical, and recommends the usual filthy
remedies, e.g. the dung of a peacock for convulsions and powdered

The preface says that the title-pages of some cookery books, ‘like

Books performed,’ but the only thing likely to displease ladies in
this book ‘will be to see so many uncommon, and wundeflour’d
Receipts prostituted to the publique view, which might perchance

separate title-pages. ‘THE COMPLEAT COOK’, nearly always sepa-
rately paged, was sometimes published by itself. The other two,
though somctimes separately paged, seem to have been nearly always
published together.

There is a portrait of Henrietta Maria Regina by Gulielmus
Faithorne as frontispiece.

Other editions are 1656, 1661, 1662, 1668, 1671, 1674, 1679, 1683,
1684, 1696 (10), 1710 (11), 1713 (11). In the British Museum the
book is catalogued under W. M.

A 1659 edition of ‘The Compleat Cook’ was probably issued by
itself, as the lettering of the sheets begins with A. One of 1664
begins with N.

The dates on the title-pages of the second and third books do
not always correspond with the date of the first title-page.

28 ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS

Doctor in Physick, and Fellow of the Colledg of Physicians
in London.

London, printed by Tho. Newcomb for Samuel Thomson, at
the sign of the White Horse in Pauls Churchyard, 1655.

This is a very interesting book on the choice and preparation of
food by Thomas Muffett, who was born in 1553 and died in 1604.
He became M.P. for Wilton in 1597. The book bears the im-
primatur of the President and Censors of the College of Physicians.
It was reprinted in 1746.

1656 THE PERFECT COOK.

Being the most exact directions for the making all kind of
Pastes, with the perfect way teaching how to Raise, Season,
and make all sorts of Pies, Pasties, Tarts, and Florentines,
etc., now practised by the most famous and expert Cooks,
both French and English.

As also the perfect English Cook, or right method of the
whole Art of Cookery, with the true ordering of French,
Spanish, and Italian Kickshaws, with Alamode varieties for
Persons of Honour.

To which is added, the way of dressing all manner of Flesh,
Fowl, and Fish, and making admirable Sauces, after the
most refined way of French and English.

The like never extant ;

With fifty-five ways of dressing of Eggs.

By Mounsieur Marnette.

Printed at London for Nath. Brooks at the Angel in Cornhil,
1656.

There is a frontispiece of two men and a woman in a kitchen,
engraved by Ro. Vaughan. A later edition of 1686 has no frontis-
piece, and probably this edition did not have one.

From the preface we see that the author was born in London of
foreign parents, and was ‘turned young into the wild and Military
World, to become a Son of Mars’. After a time he returned to
London and resigned himself ‘ to Minerva’s milder tuition and pro-
tection’. He apologizes for presenting a book on pastry ‘to this
Nation, where every Matron and young Damsel are so well vers’d
oF Pastry Art, as that they may out-vie the best Forreign Pastry

ee Orne first part of the book is a translation of Le Pastissier frangois,

Other editions are 1665 (2), 1671 (3), of which there are two
imprints, 1678 (4), 1685 (5).

As frontispiece there is a portrait with ‘Afatis Suz 71, 1660’
in background, and beneath are the lines :

According to Granger (Biog. Hist. iv. 68) the portrait is by Gaywood.
Southey quotes the title-page in Omniana, ii. 70.

There are two poems at the beginning in May’s honour, and a story
of his life which mentions that he was the son of a cook and was
trained in France. This training accounts for his giving nine recipes
for preparing snails and one for baking frogs, In the preface May
says that ‘God and my own Conscience would not permit me to
bury these my Experiences in the Grave’, and that ‘The Queens
Closet Opened ’ was the only book comparable to his own.
