Output raw text only.\n- Images or diagrams: Indicate their presence with a brief plain-text note in brackets, e.g., [Image: diagram of a cell].\n- Layout preservation: Preserve line breaks where they appear in the image.\n- Multi-column text: Transcribe multi-column text as seen on the image, divided by tabs or spaces.\n- Cross-page continuity: Preserve sentences that continue from the previous or to the next page exactly as shown.\n- Output format: Provide only the transcription text.
