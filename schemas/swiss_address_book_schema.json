These documents may contain names, residential listings, municipal records, professional directories, or related civic content.\n- Scope — include everything: Transcribe **all** visible text exactly as it appears: names, addresses, occupations, headers, footers, page numbers, annotations, etc.\n- Multi-column text: If the page has multiple columns, **transcribe column by column**.\n- Diacritics: **Preserve all original diacritics** exactly as they appear.\n- Historical orthography: Maintain original spelling conventions, archaic terminology, and non-standard abbreviations.\n- Multilingual entries: Some entries may contain German, French, or Italian text. Transcribe all languages verbatim.\n- Page numbers: Write page numbers appearing on headers and footers like this example: `<page_number>9<page_number>`.\n- Output format: Provide **only** the transcription. If and only if no transcribable text is found on the image set this field to null.\n- No fabrication: **Do not hallucinate.** Keep spelling, punctuation, and wording **verbatim**, even if they appear unusual or archaic."
